attempting to find a plot in it will be shot by order of the author per gg chief of ordnance explanatory in this book a number of dialects are used to wit the missouri negro dialect the extremest form of the backwoods southwestern dialect the ordinary pike county dialect and four modified varieties of this last the shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion or by guesswork but painstakingly and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech i make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding the author adventures of huckleberry finn scene the mississippi valley time forty to fifty years ago chapter i you dont know about me without you have read a book by the name of the adventures of tom sawyer but that aint no matter that book was made by mr mark twain and he told the truth mainly there was things which he stretched but mainly he told the truth that is nothing i never seen anybody but lied one time or another without it was aunt polly or the widow or maybe mary aunt pollytoms aunt polly she isand mary and the widow douglas is all told about in that book which is mostly a true book with some stretchers as i said before now the way that the book winds up is this tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave and it made us rich we got six thousand dollars apieceall gold it was an awful sight of money when it was piled up well judge thatcher he took it and put it out at interest and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round more than a body could tell what to do with the widow douglas she took me for her son and allowed she would sivilize me but it was rough living in the house all the time considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways and so when i couldnt stand it no longer i lit out i got into my old rags and my sugarhogshead again and was free and satisfied but tom sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers and i might join if i would go back to the widow and be respectable so i went back the widow she cried over me and called me a poor lost lamb and she called me a lot of other names too but she never meant no harm by it she put me in them new clothes again and i couldnt do nothing but sweat and sweat and feel all cramped up well then the old thing commenced again the widow rung a bell for supper and you had to come to time when you got to the table you couldnt go right to eating but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals though there warnt really anything the matter with themthat is nothing only everything was cooked by itself in a barrel of odds and ends it is different things get mixed up and the juice kind of swaps around and the things go better after supper she got out her book and learned me about moses and the bulrushers and i was in a sweat to find out all about him but by and by she let it out that moses had been dead a considerable long time so then i didnt care no more about him because i dont take no stock in dead people pretty soon i wanted to smoke and asked the widow to let me but she wouldnt she said it was a mean practice and wasnt clean and i must try to not do it any more that is just the way with some people they get down on a thing when they dont know nothing about it here she was abothering about moses which was no kin to her and no use to anybody being gone you see yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it and she took snuff too of course that was all right because she done it herself her sister miss watson a tolerable slim old maid with goggles on had just come to live with her and took a set at me now with a spellingbook she worked me middling hard for about an hour and then the widow made her ease up i couldnt stood it much longer then for an hour it was deadly dull and i was fidgety miss watson would say dont put your feet up there huckleberry and dont scrunch up like that huckleberryset up straight and pretty soon she would say dont gap and stretch like that huckleberrywhy dont you try to behave then she told me all about the bad place and i said i wished i was there she got mad then but i didnt mean no harm all i wanted was to go somewheres all i wanted was a change i warnt particular she said it was wicked to say what i said said she wouldnt say it for the whole world she was going to live so as to go to the good place well i couldnt see no advantage in going where she was going so i made up my mind i wouldnt try for it but i never said so because it would only make trouble and wouldnt do no good now she had got a start and she went on and told me all about the good place she said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing forever and ever so i didnt think much of it but i never said so i asked her if she reckoned tom sawyer would go there and she said not by a considerable sight i was glad about that because i wanted him and me to be together miss watson she kept pecking at me and it got tiresome and lonesome by and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers and then everybody was off to bed i went up to my room with a piece of candle and put it on the table then i set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful but it warnt no use i felt so lonesome i most wished i was dead the stars were shining and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful and i heard an owl away off whowhooing about somebody that was dead and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die and the wind was trying to whisper something to me and i couldnt make out what it was and so it made the cold shivers run over me then away out in the woods i heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something thats on its mind and cant make itself understood and so cant rest easy in its grave and has to go about that way every night grieving i got so downhearted and scared i did wish i had some company pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder and i flipped it off and it lit in the candle and before i could budge it was all shriveled up i didnt need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck so i was scared and most shook the clothes off of me i got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time and then i tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away but i hadnt no confidence you do that when youve lost a horseshoe that youve found instead of nailing it up over the door but i hadnt ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when youd killed a spider i set down again ashaking all over and got out my pipe for a smoke for the house was all as still as death now and so the widow wouldnt know well after a long time i heard the clock away off in the town go boomboomboomtwelve licks and all still againstiller than ever pretty soon i heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees something was a stirring i set still and listened directly i could just barely hear a meyow meyow down there that was good says i meyow meyow as soft as i could and then i put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed then i slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees and sure enough there was tom sawyer waiting for me chapter ii we went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widows garden stooping down so as the branches wouldnt scrape our heads when we was passing by the kitchen i fell over a root and made a noise we scrouched down and laid still miss watsons big nigger named jim was setting in the kitchen door we could see him pretty clear because there was a light behind him he got up and stretched his neck out about a minute listening then he says who dah he listened some more then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us we could a touched him nearly well likely it was minutes and minutes that there warnt a sound and we all there so close together there was a place on my ankle that got to itching but i dasnt scratch it and then my ear begun to itch and next my back right between my shoulders seemed like id die if i couldnt scratch well ive noticed that thing plenty times since if you are with the quality or at a funeral or trying to go to sleep when you aint sleepyif you are anywheres where it wont do for you to scratch why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places pretty soon jim says say who is you whar is you dog my cats ef i didn hear sumfn well i know what is gwyne to do is gwyne to set down here and listen tell i hears it agin so he set down on the ground betwixt me and tom he leaned his back up against a tree and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine my nose begun to itch it itched till the tears come into my eyes but i dasnt scratch then it begun to itch on the inside next i got to itching underneath i didnt know how i was going to set still this miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes but it seemed a sight longer than that i was itching in eleven different places now i reckoned i couldnt stand it moren a minute longer but i set my teeth hard and got ready to try just then jim begun to breathe heavy next he begun to snoreand then i was pretty soon comfortable again tom he made a sign to mekind of a little noise with his mouthand we went creeping away on our hands and knees when we was ten foot off tom whispered to me and wanted to tie jim to the tree for fun but i said no he might wake and make a disturbance and then theyd find out i warnt in then tom said he hadnt got candles enough and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more i didnt want him to try i said jim might wake up and come but tom wanted to resk it so we slid in there and got three candles and tom laid five cents on the table for pay then we got out and i was in a sweat to get away but nothing would do tom but he must crawl to where jim was on his hands and knees and play something on him i waited and it seemed a good while everything was so still and lonesome as soon as tom was back we cut along the path around the garden fence and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house tom said he slipped jims hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him and jim stirred a little but he didnt wake afterwards jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance and rode him all over the state and then set him under the trees again and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it and next time jim told it he said they rode him down to new orleans and after that every time he told it he spread it more and more till by and by he said they rode him all over the world and tired him most to death and his back was all over saddleboils jim was monstrous proud about it and he got so he wouldnt hardly notice the other niggers niggers would come miles to hear jim tell about it and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over same as if he was a wonder niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things jim would happen in and say hm what you know bout witches and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat jim always kept that fivecenter piece round his neck with a string and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it but he never told what it was he said to it niggers would come from all around there and give jim anything they had just for a sight of that fivecenter piece but they wouldnt touch it because the devil had had his hands on it jim was most ruined for a servant because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches well when tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling where there was sick folks maybe and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine and down by the village was the river a whole mile broad and awful still and grand we went down the hill and found jo harper and ben rogers and two or three more of the boys hid in the old tanyard so we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half to the big scar on the hillside and went ashore we went to a clump of bushes and tom made everybody swear to keep the secret and then showed them a hole in the hill right in the thickest part of the bushes then we lit the candles and crawled in on our hands and knees we went about two hundred yards and then the cave opened up tom poked about amongst the passages and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldnt a noticed that there was a hole we went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room all damp and sweaty and cold and there we stopped tom says now well start this band of robbers and call it tom sawyers gang everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath and write his name in blood everybody was willing so tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on and read it it swore every boy to stick to the band and never tell any of the secrets and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it and he mustnt eat and he mustnt sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts which was the sign of the band and nobody that didnt belong to the band could use that mark and if he did he must be sued and if he done it again he must be killed and if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets he must have his throat cut and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever everybody said it was a real beautiful oath and asked tom if he got it out of his own head he said some of it but the rest was out of piratebooks and robberbooks and every gang that was hightoned had it some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that told the secrets tom said it was a good idea so he took a pencil and wrote it in then ben rogers says heres huck finn he haint got no family what you going to do bout him well haint he got a father says tom sawyer yes hes got a father but you cant never find him these days he used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard but he haint been seen in these parts for a year or more they talked it over and they was going to rule me out because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill or else it wouldnt be fair and square for the others well nobody could think of anything to doeverybody was stumped and set still i was most ready to cry but all at once i thought of a way and so i offered them miss watsonthey could kill her everybody said oh shell do thats all right huck can come in then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with and i made my mark on the paper now says ben rogers whats the line of business of this gang nothing only robbery and murder tom said but who are we going to robhouses or cattle or stuff stealing cattle and such things aint robbery its burglary says tom sawyer we aint burglars that aint no sort of style we are highwaymen we stop stages and carriages on the road with masks on and kill the people and take their watches and money must we always kill the people oh certainly its best some authorities think different but mostly its considered best to kill themexcept some that you bring to the cave here and keep them till theyre ransomed ransomed whats that i dont know but thats what they do ive seen it in books and so of course thats what weve got to do but how can we do it if we dont know what it is why blame it all weve got to do it dont i tell you its in the books do you want to go to doing different from whats in the books and get things all muddled up oh thats all very fine to say tom sawyer but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we dont know how to do it to them thats the thing i want to get at now what do you reckon it is well i dont know but peraps if we keep them till theyre ransomed it means that we keep them till theyre dead now thats something like thatll answer why couldnt you said that before well keep them till theyre ransomed to death and a bothersome lot theyll be tooeating up everything and always trying to get loose how you talk ben rogers how can they get loose when theres a guard over them ready to shoot them down if they move a peg a guard well that is good so somebodys got to set up all night and never get any sleep just so as to watch them i think thats foolishness why cant a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here because it aint in the books sothats why now ben rogers do you want to do things regular or dont youthats the idea dont you reckon that the people that made the books knows whats the correct thing to do do you reckon you can learn em anything not by a good deal no sir well just go on and ransom them in the regular way all right i dont mind but i say its a fool way anyhow say do we kill the women too well ben rogers if i was as ignorant as you i wouldnt let on kill the women no nobody ever saw anything in the books like that you fetch them to the cave and youre always as polite as pie to them and by and by they fall in love with you and never want to go home any more well if thats the way im agreed but i dont take no stock in it mighty soon well have the cave so cluttered up with women and fellows waiting to be ransomed that there wont be no place for the robbers but go ahead i aint got nothing to say little tommy barnes was asleep now and when they waked him up he was scared and cried and said he wanted to go home to his ma and didnt want to be a robber any more so they all made fun of him and called him crybaby and that made him mad and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets but tom give him five cents to keep quiet and said we would all go home and meet next week and rob somebody and kill some people ben rogers said he couldnt get out much only sundays and so he wanted to begin next sunday but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on sunday and that settled the thing they agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could and then we elected tom sawyer first captain and jo harper second captain of the gang and so started home i clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking my new clothes was all greased up and clayey and i was dogtired chapter iii well i got a good goingover in the morning from old miss watson on account of my clothes but the widow she didnt scold but only cleaned off the grease and clay and looked so sorry that i thought i would behave awhile if i could then miss watson she took me in the closet and prayed but nothing come of it she told me to pray every day and whatever i asked for i would get it but it warnt so i tried it once i got a fishline but no hooks it warnt any good to me without hooks i tried for the hooks three or four times but somehow i couldnt make it work by and by one day i asked miss watson to try for me but she said i was a fool she never told me why and i couldnt make it out no way i set down one time back in the woods and had a long think about it i says to myself if a body can get anything they pray for why dont deacon winn get back the money he lost on pork why cant the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole why cant miss watson fat up no says i to my self there aint nothing in it i went and told the widow about it and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was spiritual gifts this was too many for me but she told me what she meanti must help other people and do everything i could for other people and look out for them all the time and never think about myself this was including miss watson as i took it i went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time but i couldnt see no advantage about itexcept for the other people so at last i reckoned i wouldnt worry about it any more but just let it go sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about providence in a way to make a bodys mouth water but maybe next day miss watson would take hold and knock it all down again i judged i could see that there was two providences and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widows providence but if miss watsons got him there warnt no help for him any more i thought it all out and reckoned i would belong to the widows if he wanted me though i couldnt make out how he was agoing to be any better off then than what he was before seeing i was so ignorant and so kind of lowdown and ornery pap he hadnt been seen for more than a year and that was comfortable for me i didnt want to see him no more he used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me though i used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around well about this time he was found in the river drownded about twelve mile above town so people said they judged it was him anyway said this drownded man was just his size and was ragged and had uncommon long hair which was all like pap but they couldnt make nothing out of the face because it had been in the water so long it warnt much like a face at all they said he was floating on his back in the water they took him and buried him on the bank but i warnt comfortable long because i happened to think of something i knowed mighty well that a drownded man dont float on his back but on his face so i knowed then that this warnt pap but a woman dressed up in a mans clothes so i was uncomfortable again i judged the old man would turn up again by and by though i wished he wouldnt we played robber now and then about a month and then i resigned all the boys did we hadnt robbed nobody hadnt killed any people but only just pretended we used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hogdrivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market but we never hived any of them tom sawyer called the hogs ingots and he called the turnips and stuff julery and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done and how many people we had killed and marked but i couldnt see no profit in it one time tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick which he called a slogan which was the sign for the gang to get together and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of spanish merchants and rich arabs was going to camp in cave hollow with two hundred elephants and six hundred camels and over a thousand sumter mules all loaded down with dimonds and they didnt have only a guard of four hundred soldiers and so we would lay in ambuscade as he called it and kill the lot and scoop the things he said we must slick up our swords and guns and get ready he never could go after even a turnipcart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it though they was only lath and broomsticks and you might scour at them till you rotted and then they warnt worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before i didnt believe we could lick such a crowd of spaniards and arabs but i wanted to see the camels and elephants so i was on hand next day saturday in the ambuscade and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill but there warnt no spaniards and arabs and there warnt no camels nor no elephants it warnt anything but a sundayschool picnic and only a primerclass at that we busted it up and chased the children up the hollow but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam though ben rogers got a rag doll and jo harper got a hymnbook and a tract and then the teacher charged in and made us drop everything and cut i didnt see no dimonds and i told tom sawyer so he said there was loads of them there anyway and he said there was arabs there too and elephants and things i said why couldnt we see them then he said if i warnt so ignorant but had read a book called don quixote i would know without asking he said it was all done by enchantment he said there was hundreds of soldiers there and elephants and treasure and so on but we had enemies which he called magicians and they had turned the whole thing into an infant sundayschool just out of spite i said all right then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians tom sawyer said i was a numskull why said he a magician could call up a lot of genies and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say jack robinson they are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church well i says spose we got some genies to help uscant we lick the other crowd then how you going to get them i dont know how do they get them why they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring and then the genies come tearing in with the thunder and lightning aripping around and the smoke arolling and everything theyre told to do they up and do it they dont think nothing of pulling a shottower up by the roots and belting a sundayschool superintendent over the head with itor any other man who makes them tear around so why whoever rubs the lamp or the ring they belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring and theyve got to do whatever he says if he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of dimonds and fill it full of chewinggum or whatever you want and fetch an emperors daughter from china for you to marry theyve got to do itand theyve got to do it before sunup next morning too and more theyve got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it you understand well says i i think they are a pack of flatheads for not keeping the palace themselves stead of fooling them away like that and whats moreif i was one of them i would see a man in jericho before i would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp how you talk huck finn why youd have to come when he rubbed it whether you wanted to or not what and i as high as a tree and as big as a church all right then i would come but i lay id make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country shucks it aint no use to talk to you huck finn you dont seem to know anything somehowperfect saphead i thought all this over for two or three days and then i reckoned i would see if there was anything in it i got an old tin lamp and an iron ring and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till i sweat like an injun calculating to build a palace and sell it but it warnt no use none of the genies come so then i judged that all that stuff was only just one of tom sawyers lies i reckoned he believed in the arabs and the elephants but as for me i think different it had all the marks of a sundayschool chapter iv well three or four months run along and it was well into the winter now i had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirtyfive and i dont reckon i could ever get any further than that if i was to live forever i dont take no stock in mathematics anyway at first i hated the school but by and by i got so i could stand it whenever i got uncommon tired i played hookey and the hiding i got next day done me good and cheered me up so the longer i went to school the easier it got to be i was getting sort of used to the widows ways too and they warnt so raspy on me living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly but before the cold weather i used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes and so that was a rest to me i liked the old ways best but i was getting so i liked the new ones too a little bit the widow said i was coming along slow but sure and doing very satisfactory she said she warnt ashamed of me one morning i happened to turn over the saltcellar at breakfast i reached for some of it as quick as i could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck but miss watson was in ahead of me and crossed me off she says take your hands away huckleberry what a mess you are always making the widow put in a good word for me but that warnt going to keep off the bad luck i knowed that well enough i started out after breakfast feeling worried and shaky and wondering where it was going to fall on me and what it was going to be there is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck but this wasnt one of them kind so i never tried to do anything but just poked along lowspirited and on the watchout i went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence there was an inch of new snow on the ground and i seen somebodys tracks they had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while and then went on around the garden fence it was funny they hadnt come in after standing around so i couldnt make it out it was very curious somehow i was going to follow around but i stooped down to look at the tracks first i didnt notice anything at first but next i did there was a cross in the left bootheel made with big nails to keep off the devil i was up in a second and shinning down the hill i looked over my shoulder every now and then but i didnt see nobody i was at judge thatchers as quick as i could get there he said why my boy you are all out of breath did you come for your interest no sir i says is there some for me oh yes a halfyearly is in last nightover a hundred and fifty dollars quite a fortune for you you had better let me invest it along with your six thousand because if you take it youll spend it no sir i says i dont want to spend it i dont want it at all nor the six thousand nuther i want you to take it i want to give it to youthe six thousand and all he looked surprised he couldnt seem to make it out he says why what can you mean my boy i says dont you ask me no questions about it please youll take it wont you he says well im puzzled is something the matter please take it says i and dont ask me nothingthen i wont have to tell no lies he studied a while and then he says ohoo i think i see you want to sell all your property to menot give it thats the correct idea then he wrote something on a paper and read it over and says there you see it says for a consideration that means i have bought it of you and paid you for it heres a dollar for you now you sign it so i signed it and left miss watsons nigger jim had a hairball as big as your fist which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox and he used to do magic with it he said there was a spirit inside of it and it knowed everything so i went to him that night and told him pap was here again for i found his tracks in the snow what i wanted to know was what he was going to do and was he going to stay jim got out his hairball and said something over it and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor it fell pretty solid and only rolled about an inch jim tried it again and then another time and it acted just the same jim got down on his knees and put his ear against it and listened but it warnt no use he said it wouldnt talk he said sometimes it wouldnt talk without money i told him i had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warnt no good because the brass showed through the silver a little and it wouldnt pass nohow even if the brass didnt show because it was so slick it felt greasy and so that would tell on it every time i reckoned i wouldnt say nothing about the dollar i got from the judge i said it was pretty bad money but maybe the hairball would take it because maybe it wouldnt know the difference jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it and said he would manage so the hairball would think it was good he said he would split open a raw irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night and next morning you couldnt see no brass and it wouldnt feel greasy no more and so anybody in town would take it in a minute let alone a hairball well i knowed a potato would do that before but i had forgot it jim put the quarter under the hairball and got down and listened again this time he said the hairball was all right he said it would tell my whole fortune if i wanted it to i says go on so the hairball talked to jim and jim told it to me he says yo ole father doan know yit what hes agwyne to do sometimes he spec hell go way en den agin he spec hell stay de bes way is to res easy en let de ole man take his own way deys two angels hoverin roun bout him one uv em is white en shiny en tother one is black de white one gits him to go right a

pungle too or ill know the reason why say how much you got in your pocket i want it i haint got only a dollar and i want that to it dont make no difference what you want it foryou just shell it out he took it and bit it to see if it was good and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky said he hadnt had a drink all day when he had got out on the shed he put his head in again and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him and when i reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again and told me to mind about that school because he was going to lay for me and lick me if i didnt drop that next day he was drunk and he went to judge thatchers and bullyragged him and tried to make him give up the money but he couldnt and then he swore hed make the law force him the judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian but it was a new judge that had just come and he didnt know the old man so he said courts mustnt interfere and separate families if they could help it said hed druther not take a child away from its father so judge thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business that pleased the old man till he couldnt rest he said hed cowhide me till i was black and blue if i didnt raise some money for him i borrowed three dollars from judge thatcher and pap took it and got drunk and went ablowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on and he kept it up all over town with a tin pan till most midnight then they jailed him and next day they had him before court and jailed him again for a week but he said he was satisfied said he was boss of his son and hed make it warm for him when he got out the new judge said he was agoing to make a man of him so he took him to his own house and dressed him up clean and nice and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family and was just old pie to him so to speak and after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried and said hed been a fool and fooled away his life but now he was agoing to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldnt be ashamed of and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him the judge said he could hug him for them words so he cried and his wife she cried again pap said hed been a man that had always been misunderstood before and the judge said he believed it the old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy and the judge said it was so so they cried again and when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand and says look at it gentlemen and ladies all take ahold of it shake it theres a hand that was the hand of a hog but it aint so no more its the hand of a man thats started in on a new life andll die before hell go back you mark them wordsdont forget i said them its a clean hand now shake itdont be afeard so they shook it one after the other all around and cried the judges wife she kissed it then the old man he signed a pledgemade his mark the judge said it was the holiest time on record or something like that then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room which was the spare room and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porchroof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of fortyrod and clumb back again and had a good old time and towards daylight he crawled out again drunk as a fiddler and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sunup and when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it the judge he felt kind of sore he said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun maybe but he didnt know no other way chapter vi well pretty soon the old man was up and around again and then he went for judge thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money and he went for me too for not stopping school he catched me a couple of times and thrashed me but i went to school just the same and dodged him or outrun him most of the time i didnt want to go to school much before but i reckoned id go now to spite pap that law trial was a slow businessappeared like they warnt ever going to get started on it so every now and then id borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him to keep from getting a cowhiding every time he got money he got drunk and every time he got drunk he raised cain around town and every time he raised cain he got jailed he was just suitedthis kind of thing was right in his line he got to hanging around the widows too much and so she told him at last that if he didnt quit using around there she would make trouble for him well wasnt he mad he said he would show who was huck finns boss so he watched out for me one day in the spring and catched me and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff and crossed over to the illinois shore where it was woody and there warnt no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldnt find it if you didnt know where it was he kept me with him all the time and i never got a chance to run off we lived in that old cabin and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights he had a gun which he had stole i reckon and we fished and hunted and that was what we lived on every little while he locked me in and went down to the store three miles to the ferry and traded fish and game for whisky and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time and licked me the widow she found out where i was by and by and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me but pap drove him off with the gun and it warnt long after that till i was used to being where i was and liked itall but the cowhide part it was kind of lazy and jolly laying off comfortable all day smoking and fishing and no books nor study two months or more run along and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt and i didnt see how id ever got to like it so well at the widows where you had to wash and eat on a plate and comb up and go to bed and get up regular and be forever bothering over a book and have old miss watson pecking at you all the time i didnt want to go back no more i had stopped cussing because the widow didnt like it but now i took to it again because pap hadnt no objections it was pretty good times up in the woods there take it all around but by and by pap got too handy with his hickry and i couldnt stand it i was all over welts he got to going away so much too and locking me in once he locked me in and was gone three days it was dreadful lonesome i judged he had got drownded and i wasnt ever going to get out any more i was scared i made up my mind i would fix up some way to leave there i had tried to get out of that cabin many a time but i couldnt find no way there warnt a window to it big enough for a dog to get through i couldnt get up the chimbly it was too narrow the door was thick solid oak slabs pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away i reckon i had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times well i was most all the time at it because it was about the only way to put in the time but this time i found something at last i found an old rusty woodsaw without any handle it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof i greased it up and went to work there was an old horseblanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out i got under the table and raised the blanket and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log outbig enough to let me through well it was a good long job but i was getting towards the end of it when i heard paps gun in the woods i got rid of the signs of my work and dropped the blanket and hid my saw and pretty soon pap come in pap warnt in a good humorso he was his natural self he said he was down town and everything was going wrong his lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial but then there was ways to put it off a long time and judge thatcher knowed how to do it and he said people allowed thered be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian and they guessed it would win this time this shook me up considerable because i didnt want to go back to the widows any more and be so cramped up and sivilized as they called it then the old man got to cussing and cussed everything and everybody he could think of and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadnt skipped any and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round including a considerable parcel of people which he didnt know the names of and so called them whatshisname when he got to them and went right along with his cussing he said he would like to see the widow get me he said he would watch out and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldnt find me that made me pretty uneasy again but only for a minute i reckoned i wouldnt stay on hand till he got that chance the old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got there was a fiftypound sack of corn meal and a side of bacon ammunition and a fourgallon jug of whisky and an old book and two newspapers for wadding besides some tow i toted up a load and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest i thought it all over and i reckoned i would walk off with the gun and some lines and take to the woods when i run away i guessed i wouldnt stay in one place but just tramp right across the country mostly night times and hunt and fish to keep alive and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldnt ever find me any more i judged i would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough and i reckoned he would i got so full of it i didnt notice how long i was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether i was asleep or drownded i got the things all up to the cabin and then it was about dark while i was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up and went to ripping again he had been drunk over in town and laid in the gutter all night and he was a sight to look at a body would a thought he was adamhe was just all mud whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment this time he says call this a govment why just look at it and see what its like heres the law astanding ready to take a mans son away from hima mans own son which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising yes just as that man has got that son raised at last and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin for him and give him a rest the law up and goes for him and they call that govment that aint all nuther the law backs that old judge thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o my property heres what the law does the law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and upards and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this and lets him go round in clothes that aint fitten for a hog they call that govment a man cant get his rights in a govment like this sometimes ive a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all yes and i told em so i told old thatcher so to his face lots of em heard me and can tell what i said says i for two cents id leave the blamed country and never come anear it agin thems the very words i says look at my hatif you call it a hatbut the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till its below my chin and then it aint rightly a hat at all but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o stovepipe look at it says i such a hat for me to wearone of the wealthiest men in this town if i could git my rights oh yes this is a wonderful govment wonderful why looky here there was a free nigger there from ohioa mulatter most as white as a white man he had the whitest shirt on you ever see too and the shiniest hat and there aint a man in that town thats got as fine clothes as what he had and he had a gold watch and chain and a silverheaded canethe awfulest old grayheaded nabob in the state and what do you think they said he was a pfessor in a college and could talk all kinds of languages and knowed everything and that aint the wust they said he could vote when he was at home well that let me out thinks i what is the country acoming to it was lection day and i was just about to go and vote myself if i warnt too drunk to get there but when they told me there was a state in this country where theyd let that nigger vote i drawed out i says ill never vote agin thems the very words i said they all heard me and the country may rot for all meill never vote agin as long as i live and to see the cool way of that niggerwhy he wouldnt a give me the road if i hadnt shoved him out o the way i says to the people why aint this nigger put up at auction and soldthats what i want to know and what do you reckon they said why they said he couldnt be sold till hed been in the state six months and he hadnt been there that long yet there nowthats a specimen they call that a govment that cant sell a free nigger till hes been in the state six months heres a govment that calls itself a govment and lets on to be a govment and thinks it is a govment and yets got to set stockstill for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling thieving infernal whiteshirted free nigger and pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of languagemostly hove at the nigger and the govment though he give the tub some too all along here and there he hopped around the cabin considerable first on one leg and then on the other holding first one shin and then the other one and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick but it warnt good judgment because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it so now he raised a howl that fairly made a bodys hair raise and down he went in the dirt and rolled there and held his toes and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous he said so his own self afterwards he had heard old sowberry hagan in his best days and he said it laid over him too but i reckon that was sort of piling it on maybe after supper pap took the jug and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens that was always his word i judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour and then i would steal the key or saw myself out one or tother he drank and drank and tumbled down on his blankets by and by but luck didnt run my way he didnt go sound asleep but was uneasy he groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time at last i got so sleepy i couldnt keep my eyes open all i could do and so before i knowed what i was about i was sound asleep and the candle burning i dont know how long i was asleep but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and i was up there was pap looking wild and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes he said they was crawling up his legs and then he would give a jump and scream and say one had bit him on the cheekbut i couldnt see no snakes he started and run round and round the cabin hollering take him off take him off hes biting me on the neck i never see a man look so wild in the eyes pretty soon he was all fagged out and fell down panting then he rolled over and over wonderful fast kicking things every which way and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands and screaming and saying there was devils ahold of him he wore out by and by and laid still a while moaning then he laid stiller and didnt make a sound i could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods and it seemed terrible still he was laying over by the corner by and by he raised up part way and listened with his head to one side he says very low tramptramptramp thats the dead tramptramptramp theyre coming after me but i wont go oh theyre here dont touch me dont hands offtheyre cold let go oh let a poor devil alone then he went down on all fours and crawled off begging them to let him alone and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table still abegging and then he went to crying i could hear him through the blanket by and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild and he see me and went for me he chased me round and round the place with a claspknife calling me the angel of death and saying he would kill me and then i couldnt come for him no more i begged and told him i was only huck but he laughed such a screechy laugh and roared and cussed and kept on chasing me up once when i turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders and i thought i was gone but i slid out of the jacket quick as lightning and saved myself pretty soon he was all tired out and dropped down with his back against the door and said he would rest a minute and then kill me he put his knife under him and said he would sleep and get strong and then he would see who was who so he dozed off pretty soon by and by i got the old splitbottom chair and clumb up as easy as i could not to make any noise and got down the gun i slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded then i laid it across the turnip barrel pointing towards pap and set down behind it to wait for him to stir and how slow and still the time did drag along chapter vii git up what you bout i opened my eyes and looked around trying to make out where i was it was after sunup and i had been sound asleep pap was standing over me looking sour and sick too he says what you doin with this gun i judged he didnt know nothing about what he had been doing so i says somebody tried to get in so i was laying for him why didnt you roust me out well i tried to but i couldnt i couldnt budge you well all right dont stand there palavering all day but out with you and see if theres a fish on the lines for breakfast ill be along in a minute he unlocked the door and i cleared out up the riverbank i noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down and a sprinkling of bark so i knowed the river had begun to rise i reckoned i would have great times now if i was over at the town the june rise used to be always luck for me because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down and pieces of log raftssometimes a dozen logs together so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the woodyards and the sawmill i went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and tother one out for what the rise might fetch along well all at once here comes a canoe just a beauty too about thirteen or fourteen foot long riding high like a duck i shot headfirst off of the bank like a frog clothes and all on and struck out for the canoe i just expected thered be somebody laying down in it because people often done that to fool folks and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it theyd raise up and laugh at him but it warnt so this time it was a driftcanoe sure enough and i clumb in and paddled her ashore thinks i the old man will be glad when he sees thisshes worth ten dollars but when i got to shore pap wasnt in sight yet and as i was running her into a little creek like a gully all hung over with vines and willows i struck another idea i judged id hide her good and then stead of taking to the woods when i run off id go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good and not have such a rough time tramping on foot it was pretty close to the shanty and i thought i heard the old man coming all the time but i got her hid and then i out and looked around a bunch of willows and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun so he hadnt seen anything when he got along i was hard at it taking up a trot line he abused me a little for being so slow but i told him i fell in the river and that was what made me so long i knowed he would see i was wet and then he would be asking questions we got five catfish off the lines and went home while we laid off after breakfast to sleep up both of us being about wore out i got to thinking that if i could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me you see all kinds of things might happen well i didnt see no way for a while but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water and he says another time a man comes aprowling round here you roust me out you hear that man warnt here for no good id a shot him next time you roust me out you hear then he dropped down and went to sleep again but what he had been saying give me the very idea i wanted i says to myself i can fix it now so nobody wont think of following me about twelve oclock we turned out and went along up the bank the river was coming up pretty fast and lots of driftwood going by on the rise by and by along comes part of a log raftnine logs fast together we went out with the skiff and towed it ashore then we had dinner anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through so as to catch more stuff but that warnt paps style nine logs was enough for one time he must shove right over to town and sell so he locked me in and took the skiff and started off towing the raft about halfpast three i judged he wouldnt come back that night i waited till i reckoned he had got a good start then i out with my saw and went to work on that log again before he was tother side of the river i was out of the hole him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder i took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in then i done the same with the side of bacon then the whiskyjug i took all the coffee and sugar there was and all the ammunition i took the wadding i took the bucket and gourd i took a dipper and a tin cup and my old saw and two blankets and the skillet and the coffeepot i took fishlines and matches and other thingseverything that was worth a cent i cleaned out the place i wanted an axe but there wasnt any only the one out at the woodpile and i knowed why i was going to leave that i fetched out the gun and now i was done i had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things so i fixed that as good as i could from the outside by scattering dust on the place which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust then i fixed the piece of log back into its place and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there for it was bent up at that place and didnt quite touch ground if you stood four or five foot away and didnt know it was sawed you wouldnt never notice it and besides this was the back of the cabin and it warnt likely anybody would go fooling around there it was all grass clear to the canoe so i hadnt left a track i followed around to see i stood on the bank and looked out over the river all safe so i took the gun and went up a piece into the woods and was hunting around for some birds when i see a wild pig hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms i shot this fellow and took him into camp i took the axe and smashed in the door i beat it and hacked it considerable adoing it i fetched the pig in and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe and laid him down on the ground to bleed i say ground because it was groundhard packed and no boards well next i took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in itall i could dragand i started it from the pig and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in and down it sunk out of sight you could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground i did wish tom sawyer was there i knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business and throw in the fancy touches nobody could spread himself like tom sawyer in such a thing as that well last i pulled out some of my hair and blooded the axe good and stuck it on the back side and slung the axe in the corner then i took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket so he couldnt drip till i got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river now i thought of something else so i went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe and fetched them to the house i took the bag to where it used to stand and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw for there warnt no knives and forks on the place pap done everything with his claspknife about the cooking then i carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushesand ducks too you might say in the season there was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away i dont know where but it didnt go to the river the meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake i dropped paps whetstone there too so as to look like it had been done by accident then i tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string so it wouldnt leak no more and took it and my saw to the canoe again it was about dark now so i dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank and waited for the moon to rise i made fast to a willow then i took a bite to eat and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan i says to myself theyll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me and theyll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things they wont ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass theyll soon get tired of that and wont bother no more about me all right i can stop anywhere i want to jacksons island is good enough for me i know that island pretty well and nobody ever comes there and then i can paddle over to town nights and slink around and pick up things i want jacksons islands the place i was pretty tired and the first thing i knowed i was asleep when i woke up i didnt know where i was for a minute i set up and looked around a little scared then i remembered the river looked miles and miles across the moon was so bright i could a counted the drift logs that went aslipping along black and still hundreds of yards out from shore everything was dead quiet and it looked late and smelt late you know what i meani dont know the words to put it in i took a good gap and a stretch and was just going to unhitch and start when i heard a sound away over the water i listened pretty soon i made it out it was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when its a still night i peeped out through the willow branches and there it wasa skiff away across the water i couldnt tell how many was in it it kept acoming and when it was abreast of me i see there warnt but one man in it thinks i maybe its pap though i warnt expecting him he dropped below me with the current and by and by he came aswinging up shore in the easy water and he went by so close i could a reached out the gun and touched him well it was pap sure enoughand sober too by the way he laid his oars i didnt lose no time the next minute i was aspinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank i made two mile and a half and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river because pretty soon i would be passing the ferry landing and people might see me and hail me i got out amongst the driftwood and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float i laid there and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe looking away into the sky not a cloud in it the sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine i never knowed it before and how far a body can hear on the water such nights i heard people talking at the ferry landing i heard what they said tooevery word of it one man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now tother one said this warnt one of the short ones he reckonedand then they laughed and he said it over again and they laughed again then they waked up another fellow and told him and laughed but he didnt laugh he ripped out something brisk and said let him alone the first fellow said he lowed to tell it to his old womanshe would think it was pretty good but he said that warnt nothing to some things he had said in his time i heard one man say it was nearly three oclock and he hoped daylight wouldnt wait more than about a week longer after that the talk got further and further away and i couldnt make out the words any more but i could hear the mumble and now and then a laugh too but it seemed a long ways off i was away below the ferry now i rose up and there was jacksons island about two mile and a half down stream heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river big and dark and solid like a steamboat without any lights there warnt any signs of the bar at the headit was all under water now it didnt take me long to get there i shot past the head at a ripping rate the current was so swift and then i got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the illinois shore i run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that i knowed about i had to part the willow branches to get in and when i made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside i went up and set down on a log at the head of the island and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town three mile away where there was three or four lights twinkling a monstrous big lumberraft was about a mile up stream coming along down with a lantern in the middle of it i watched it come creeping down and when it was most abreast of where i stood i heard a man say stern oars there heave her head to stabboard i heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side there was a little gray in the sky now so i stepped into the woods and laid down for a nap before breakfast chapter viii the sun was up so high when i waked that i judged it was after eight oclock i laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied i could see the sun out at one or two holes but mostly it was big trees all about and gloomy in there amongst them there was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves and the freckled places swapped about a little showing there was a little breeze up there a couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly i was powerful lazy and comfortabledidnt want to get up and cook breakfast well i was dozing off again when i thinks i hears a deep sound of boom away up the river i rouses up and rests on my elbow and listens pretty soon i hears it again i hopped up and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves and i see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways upabout abreast the ferry and there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down i knowed what was the matter now boom i see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboats side you see they was firing cannon over the water trying to make my carcass come to the top i was pretty hungry but it warnt going to do for me to start a fire because they might see the smoke so i set there and watched the cannonsmoke and listened to the boom the river was a mile wide there and it always looks pretty on a summer morningso i was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if i only had a bite to eat well then i happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there so says i ill keep a lookout and if any of thems floating around after me ill give them a show i changed to the illinois edge of the island to see what luck i could have and i warnt disappointed a big double loaf come along and i most got it with a long stick but my foot slipped and she floated out further of course i was where the current set in the closest to the shorei knowed enough for that but by and by along comes another one and this time i won i took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver and set my teeth in it was bakers breadwhat the quality eat none of your lowdown cornpone i got a good place amongst the leaves and set there on a log munching the bread and watching the ferryboat and very well satisfied and then something struck me i says now i reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me and here it has gone and done it so there aint no doubt but there is something in that thing that is theres something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays but it dont work for me and i reckon it dont work for only just the right kind i lit a pipe and had a good long smoke and went on watching the ferryboat was floating with the current and i allowed id have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along because she would come in close where the bread did when shed got pretty well along down towards me i put out my pipe and went to where i fished out the bread and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place where the log forked i could peep through by and by she come along and she drifted in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore most everybody was on the boat pap and judge thatcher and bessie thatcher and jo harper and tom sawyer and his old aunt polly and sid and mary and plenty more everybody was talking about the murder but the captain broke in and says look sharp now the current sets in the closest here and maybe hes washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the waters edge i hope so anyway i didnt hope so they all crowded up and leaned over the rails nearly in my face and kept still watching with all their might i could see them firstrate but they couldnt see me then the captain sung out stand away and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke and i judged i was gone if theyd a had some bullets in i reckon theyd a got the corpse they was after well i see i warnt hurt thanks to goodness the boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island i could hear the booming now and then further and further off and by and by after an hour i didnt hear it no more the island was three mile long i judged they had got to the foot and was giving it up but they didnt yet a while they turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the missouri side under steam and booming once in a while as they went i crossed over to that side and watched them when they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the missouri shore and went home to the town i knowed i was all right now nobody else would come ahunting after me i got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods i made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldnt get at them i catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw and towards sundown i started my camp fire and had supper then i set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast when it was dark i set by my camp fire smoking and feeling pretty well satisfied but by and by it got sort of lonesome and so i went and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing along and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down and then went to bed there aint no better way to put in time when you are lonesome you cant stay so you soon get over it and so for three days and nights no differencejust the same thing but the next day i went exploring around down through the island i was boss of it it all belonged to me so to say and i wanted to know all about it but mainly i wanted to put in the time i found plenty strawberries ripe and prime and green summer grapes and green razberries and the green blackberries was just beginning to show they would all come handy by and by i judged well i went fooling along in the deep woods till i judged i warnt far from the foot of the island i had my gun along but i hadnt shot nothing it was for protection thought i would kill some game nigh home about this time i mighty near stepped on a goodsized snake and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers and i after it trying to get a shot at it i clipped along and all of a sudden i bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking my heart jumped up amongst my lungs i never waited for to look further but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever i could every now and then i stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened but my breath come so hard i couldnt hear nothing else i slunk along another piece further then listened again and so on and so on if i see a stump i took it for a man if i trod on a stick and broke it it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and i only got half and the short half too when i got to camp i warnt feeling very brash there warnt much sand in my craw but i says this aint no time to be fooling around so i got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight and i put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last years camp and then clumb a tree i reckon i was up in the tree two hours but i didnt see nothing i didnt hear nothingi only thought i heard and seen as much as a thousand things well i couldnt stay up there forever so at last i got down but i kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time all i could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast by the time it was night i was pretty hungry so when it was good and dark i slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the illinois bankabout a quarter of a mile i went out in the woods and cooked a supper and i had about made up my mind i would stay there all night when i hear a plunketyplunk plunketyplunk and says to myself horses coming and next i hear peoples voices i got everything into the canoe as quick as i could and then went creeping through the woods to see what i could find out i hadnt got far when i hear a man say we better camp here if we can find a good place the horses is about beat out lets look around i didnt wait but shoved out and paddled away easy i tied up in the old place and reckoned i would sleep in the canoe i didnt sleep much i couldnt somehow for thinking and every time i waked up i thought somebody had me by the neck so the sleep didnt do me no good by and by i says to myself i cant live this way im agoing to find out who it is thats here on the island with me ill find it out or bust well i felt better right off so i took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows the moon was shining and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day i poked along well on to an hour everything still as rocks and sound asleep well by this time i was most down to the foot of the island a little ripply cool breeze begun to blow and that was as good as saying the night was about done i give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore then i got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods i sat down there on a log and looked out through the leaves i see the moon go off watch and the darkness begin to blanket the river but in a little while i see a pale streak over the treetops and knowed the day was coming so i took my gun and slipped off towards where i had run across that camp fire stopping every minute or two to listen but i hadnt no luck somehow i couldnt seem to find the place but by and by sure enough i catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees i went for it cautious and slow by and by i was close enough to have a look and there laid a man on the ground it most give me the fantods he had a blanket around his head and his head was nearly in the fire i set there behind a clump of bushes in about six foot of him and kept my eyes on him steady it was getting gray daylight now pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket and it was miss watsons jim i bet i was glad to see him i says hello jim and skipped out he bounced up and stared at me wild then he drops down on his knees and puts his hands together and says doan hurt medont i haint ever done no harm to a ghos i alwuz liked dead people en done all i could for em you go en git in de river agin whah you blongs en doan do nuffn to ole jim at uz awluz yo fren well i warnt long making him understand i warnt dead i was ever so glad to see jim i warnt lonesome now i

fetched meal and bacon and coffee and coffeepot and fryingpan and sugar and tin cups and the nigger was set back considerable because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft i catched a good big catfish too and jim cleaned him with his knife and fried him when breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot jim laid it in with all his might for he was most about starved then when we had got pretty well stuffed we laid off and lazied by and by jim says but looky here huck who wuz it dat uz killed in dat shanty ef it warnt you then i told him the whole thing and he said it

me he said it was death he said his father laid mighty sick once and some of them catched a bird and his old granny said his father would die and he did and jim said you mustnt count the things you are going to cook for dinner because that would bring bad luck the same if you shook the tablecloth after sundown and he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died the bees must be told about it before sunup next morning or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die jim said bees wouldnt sting idiots but i didnt believe that because i had tried them lots of times myself and they wouldnt sting me i had heard about some of these things before but not all of them jim knowed all kinds of signs he said he knowed most everything i said it looked to me like all the signs was

time or other yes en is rich now come to look at it i owns mysef en is wuth eight hundd dollars i wisht i had de money i wouldn want no mo chapter ix i wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island that id found when i was exploring so we started and soon got to it because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide this place was a tolerable long steep hill or ridge about forty foot high we had a rough time getting to the top the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick we tramped and clumb around all over it and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock most up to the top on the side towards illinois the cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together and jim could stand up straight in it it was cool in there jim was for putting our traps in there right away but i said we didnt want to be climbing up and down there all the time jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place and had all the traps in the cavern we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island and they would never find us without dogs and besides he said them little birds had said it was going to rain and did i want the things to get wet so we went back and got the canoe and paddled up abreast the cavern and lugged all the traps up there then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in amongst the thick willows we took some fish off of the lines and set them again and begun to get ready for dinner the door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit and was flat and a good place to build a fire on so we built it there and cooked dinner we spread the blankets inside for a carpet and eat our dinner in there we put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern pretty soon it darkened up and begun to thunder and lighten so the birds was right about it directly it begun to rain and it rained like all fury too and i never see the wind blow so it was one of these regular summer storms it would get so dark that it looked all blueblack outside and lovely and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spiderwebby and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild and next when it was just about the bluest and blackestfst it was as bright as glory and youd have a little glimpse of treetops aplunging about away off yonder in the storm hundreds of yards further than you could see before dark as sin again in a second and now youd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash and then go rumbling grumbling tumbling down the sky towards the under side of the world like rolling empty barrels down stairswhere its long stairs and they bounce a good deal you know jim this is nice i says i wouldnt want to be nowhere else but here pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot cornbread well you wouldnt a ben here f it hadnt a ben for jim youd a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner en gittn mos drownded too dat you would honey chickens knows when its gwyne to rain en so do de birds chile the river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days till at last it was over the banks the water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the illinois bottom on that side it was a good many miles wide but on the missouri side it was the same old distance acrossa half a milebecause the missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe it was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods even if the sun was blazing outside we went winding in and out amongst the trees and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way well on every old brokendown tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame on account of being hungry that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to but not the snakes and turtlesthey would slide off in the water the ridge our cavern was in was full of them we could a had pets enough if wed wanted them one night we catched a little section of a lumber raftnice pine planks it was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long and the top stood above water six or seven inchesa solid level floor we could see sawlogs go by in the daylight sometimes but we let them go we didnt show ourselves in daylight another night when we was up at the head of the island just before daylight here comes a framehouse down on the west side she was a twostory and tilted over considerable we paddled out and got aboard clumb in at an upstairs window but it was too dark to see yet so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight the light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island then we looked in at the window we could make out a bed and a table and two old chairs and lots of things around about on the floor and there was clothes hanging against the wall there was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man so jim says hello you but it didnt budge so i hollered again and then jim says de man aint asleephes dead you hold stillill go en see he went and bent down and looked and says its a dead man yes indeedy naked too hes ben shot in de back i reckn hes ben dead two er three days come in huck but doan look at his faceits too gashly i didnt look at him at all jim throwed some old rags over him but he neednt done it i didnt want to see him there was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor and old whisky bottles and a couple of masks made out of black cloth and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal there was two old dirty calico dresses and a sunbonnet and some womens underclothes hanging against the wall and some mens clothing too we put the lot into the canoeit might come good there was a boys old speckled straw hat on the floor i took that too and there was a bottle that had had milk in it and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck we would a took the bottle but it was broke there was a seedy old chest and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke they stood open but there warnt nothing left in them that was any account the way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry and warnt fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff we got an old tin lantern and a butcherknife without any handle and a brannew barlow knife worth two bits in any store and a lot of tallow candles and a tin candlestick and a gourd and a tin cup and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it and a hatchet and some nails and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it and a roll of buckskin and a leather dogcollar and a horseshoe and some vials of medicine that didnt have no label on them and just as we was leaving i found a tolerable good currycomb and jim he found a ratty old fiddlebow and a wooden leg the straps was broke off of it but barring that it was a good enough leg though it was too long for me and not long enough for jim and we couldnt find the other one though we hunted all around and so take it all around we made a good haul when we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island and it was pretty broad day so i made jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off i paddled over to the illinois shore and drifted down most a half a mile doing it i crept up the dead water under the bank and hadnt no accidents and didnt see nobody we got home all safe chapter x after breakfast i wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed but jim didnt want to he said it would fetch bad luck and besides he said he might come and hant us he said a man that warnt buried was more likely to go ahanting around than one that was planted and comfortable that sounded pretty reasonable so i didnt say no more but i couldnt keep from studying over it and wishing i knowed who shot the man and what they done it for we rummaged the clothes wed got and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat because if theyd a knowed the money was there they wouldnt a left it i said i reckoned they killed him too but jim didnt want to talk about that i says now you think its bad luck but what did you say when i fetched in the snakeskin that i found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday you said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snakeskin with my hands well heres your bad luck weve raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides i wish we could have some bad luck like this every day jim never you mind honey never you mind dont you git too peart its acomin mind i tell you its acomin it did come too it was a tuesday that we had that talk well after dinner friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge and got out of tobacco i went to the cavern to get some and found a rattlesnake in there i killed him and curled him up on the foot of jims blanket ever so natural thinking thered be some fun when jim found him there well by night i forgot all about the snake and when jim flung himself down on the blanket while i struck a light the snakes mate was there and bit him he jumped up yelling and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring i laid him out in a second with a stick and jim grabbed paps whiskyjug and begun to pour it down he was barefooted and the snake bit him right on the heel that all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it jim told me to chop off the snakes head and throw it away and then skin the body and roast a piece of it i done it and he eat it and said it would help cure him he made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist too he said that that would help then i slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes for i warnt going to let jim find out it was all my fault not if i could help it jim sucked and sucked at the jug and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again his foot swelled up pretty big and so did his leg but by and by the drunk begun to come and so i judged he was all right but id druther been bit with a snake than paps whisky jim was laid up for four days and nights then the swelling was all gone and he was around again i made up my mind i wouldnt ever take aholt of a snakeskin again with my hands now that i see what had come of it jim said he reckoned i would believe him next time and he said that handling a snakeskin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadnt got to the end of it yet he said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snakeskin in his hand well i was getting to feel that way myself though ive always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do old hank bunker done it once and bragged about it and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shottower and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer as you may say and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin and buried him so so they say but i didnt see it pap told me but anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way like a fool well the days went along and the river went down between its banks again and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man being six foot two inches long and weighed over two hundred pounds we couldnt handle him of course he would a flung us into illinois we just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded we found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball and lots of rubbage we split the ball open with the hatchet and there was a spool in it jim said hed had it there a long time to coat it over so and make a ball of it it was as big a fish as was ever catched in the mississippi i reckon jim said he hadnt ever seen a bigger one he would a been worth a good deal over at the village they peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the markethouse there everybody buys some of him his meats as white as snow and makes a good fry next morning i said it was getting slow and dull and i wanted to get a stirring up some way i said i reckoned i would slip over the river and find out what was going on jim liked that notion but he said i must go in the dark and look sharp then he studied it over and said couldnt i put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl that was a good notion too so we shortened up one of the calico gowns and i turned up my trouserlegs to my knees and got into it jim hitched it behind with the hooks and it was a fair fit i put on the sunbonnet and tied it under my chin and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stovepipe jim said nobody would know me even in the daytime hardly i practiced around all day to get the hang of the things and by and by i could do pretty well in them only jim said i didnt walk like a girl and he said i must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britchespocket i took notice and done better i started up the illinois shore in the canoe just after dark i started across to the town from a little below the ferrylanding and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town i tied up and started along the bank there was a light burning in a little shanty that hadnt been lived in for a long time and i wondered who had took up quarters there i slipped up and peeped in at the window there was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table i didnt know her face she was a stranger for you couldnt start a face in that town that i didnt know now this was lucky because i was weakening i was getting afraid i had come people might know my voice and find me out but if this woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all i wanted to know so i knocked at the door and made up my mind i wouldnt forget i was a girl chapter xi come in says the woman and i did she says take a cheer i done it she looked me all over with her little shiny eyes and says what might your name be sarah williams where bouts do you live in this neighborhood nom in hookerville seven mile below ive walked all the way and im all tired out hungry too i reckon ill find you something nom i aint hungry i was so hungry i had to stop two miles below here at a farm so i aint hungry no more its what makes me so late my mothers down sick and out of money and everything and i come to tell my uncle abner moore he lives at the upper end of the town she says i haint ever been here before do you know him no but i dont know everybody yet i havent lived here quite two weeks its a considerable ways to the upper end of the town you better stay here all night take off your bonnet no i says ill rest a while i reckon and go on i aint afeared of the dark she said she wouldnt let me go by myself but her husband would be in by and by maybe in a hour and a half and shed send him along with me then she got to talking about her husband and about her relations up the river and her relations down the river and about how much better off they used to was and how they didnt know but theyd made a mistake coming to our town instead of letting well aloneand so on and so on till i was afeard i had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder and then i was pretty willing to let her clatter right along she told about me and tom sawyer finding the six thousand dollars only she got it ten and all about pap and what a hard lot he was and what a hard lot i was and at last she got down to where i was murdered i says who done it weve heard considerable about these goings on down in hookerville but we dont know who twas that killed huck finn well i reckon theres a right smart chance of people here thatd like to know who killed him some think old finn done it himself nois that so most everybody thought it at first hell never know how nigh he come to getting lynched but before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named jim why he i stopped i reckoned i better keep still she run on and never noticed i had put in at all the nigger run off the very night huck finn was killed so theres a reward out for himthree hundred dollars and theres a reward out for old finn tootwo hundred dollars you see he come to town the morning after the murder and told about it and was out with em on the ferryboat hunt and right away after he up and left before night they wanted to lynch him but he was gone you see well next day they found out the nigger was gone they found out he hadnt ben seen sence ten oclock the night the murder was done so then they put it on him you see and while they was full of it next day back comes old finn and went boohooing to judge thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over illinois with the judge gave him some and that evening he got drunk and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hardlooking strangers and then went off with them well he haint come back sence and they aint looking for him back till this thing blows over a little for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it and then hed get hucks money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit people do say he warnt any too good to do it oh hes sly i reckon if he dont come back for a year hell be all right you cant prove anything on him you know everything will be quieted down then and hell walk in hucks money as easy as nothing yes i reckon so m i dont see nothing in the way of it has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it oh no not everybody a good many thinks he done it but theyll get the nigger pretty soon now and maybe they can scare it out of him why are they after him yet well youre innocent aint you does three hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up some folks think the nigger aint far from here im one of thembut i haint talked it around a few days ago i was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call jacksons island dont anybody live there says i no nobody says they i didnt say any more but i done some thinking i was pretty near certain id seen smoke over there about the head of the island a day or two before that so i says to myself like as not that niggers hiding over there anyway says i its worth the trouble to give the place a hunt i haint seen any smoke sence so i reckon maybe hes gone if it was him but husbands going over to see him and another man he was gone up the river but he got back today and i told him as soon as he got here two hours ago i had got so uneasy i couldnt set still i had to do something with my hands so i took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it my hands shook and i was making a bad job of it when the woman stopped talking i looked up and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little i put down the needle and thread and let on to be interested and i was tooand says three hundred dollars is a power of money i wish my mother could get it is your husband going over there tonight oh yes he went uptown with the man i was telling you of to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun theyll go over after midnight couldnt they see better if they was to wait till daytime yes and couldnt the nigger see better too after midnight hell likely be asleep and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark if hes got one i didnt think of that the woman kept looking at me pretty curious and i didnt feel a bit comfortable pretty soon she says what did you say your name was honey mmary williams somehow it didnt seem to me that i said it was mary before so i didnt look upseemed to me i said it was sarah so i felt sort of cornered and was afeared maybe i was looking it too i wished the woman would say something more the longer she set still the uneasier i was but now she says honey i thought you said it was sarah when you first come in oh yesm i did sarah mary williams sarahs my first name some calls me sarah some calls me mary oh thats the way of it yesm i was feeling better then but i wished i was out of there anyway i couldnt look up yet well the woman fell to talking about how hard times was and how poor they had to live and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place and so forth and so on and then i got easy again she was right about the rats youd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while she said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone or they wouldnt give her no peace she showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot and said she was a good shot with it generly but shed wrenched her arm a day or two ago and didnt know whether she could throw true now but she watched for a chance and directly banged away at a rat but she missed him wide and said ouch it hurt her arm so then she told me to try for the next one i wanted to be getting away before the old man got back but of course i didnt let on i got the thing and the first rat that showed his nose i let drive and if hed a stayed where he was hed a been a tolerable sick rat she said that was firstrate and she reckoned i would hive the next one she went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with i held up my two hands and she put the hank over them and went on talking about her and her husbands matters but she broke off to say keep your eye on the rats you better have the lead in your lap handy so she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment and i clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking but only about a minute then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face and very pleasant and says come now whats your real name whwhat mum whats your real name is it bill or tom or bobor what is it i reckon i shook like a leaf and i didnt know hardly what to do but i says please to dont poke fun at a poor girl like me mum if im in the way here ill no you wont set down and stay where you are i aint going to hurt you and i aint going to tell on you nuther you just tell me your secret and trust me ill keep it and whats more ill help you soll my old man if you want him to you see youre a runaway prentice thats all it aint anything there aint no harm in it youve been treated bad and you made up your mind to cut bless you child i wouldnt tell on you tell me all about it now thats a good boy so i said it wouldnt be no use to try to play it any longer and i would just make a clean breast and tell her everything but she musnt go back on her promise then i told her my father and mother was dead and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river and he treated me so bad i couldnt stand it no longer he went away to be gone a couple of days and so i took my chance and stole some of his daughters old clothes and cleared out and i had been three nights coming the thirty miles i traveled nights and hid daytimes and slept and the bag of bread and meat i carried from home lasted me all the way and i had aplenty i said i believed my uncle abner moore would take care of me and so that was why i struck out for this town of goshen goshen child this aint goshen this is st petersburg goshens ten mile further up the river who told you this was goshen why a man i met at daybreak this morning just as i was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep he told me when the roads forked i must take the right hand and five mile would fetch me to goshen he was drunk i reckon he told you just exactly wrong well he did act like he was drunk but it aint no matter now i got to be moving along ill fetch goshen before daylight hold on a minute ill put you up a snack to eat you might want it so she put me up a snack and says say when a cows laying down which end of her gets up first answer up prompt nowdont stop to study over it which end gets up first the hind end mum well then a horse the forrard end mum which side of a tree does the moss grow on north side if fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction the whole fifteen mum well i reckon you have lived in the country i thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again whats your real name now george peters mum well try to remember it george dont forget and tell me its elexander before you go and then get out by saying its george elexander when i catch you and dont go about women in that old calico you do a girl tolerable poor but you might fool men maybe bless you child when you set out to thread a needle dont hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it hold the needle still and poke the thread at it thats the way a woman most always does but a man always does tother way and when you throw at a rat or anything hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can and miss your rat about six or seven foot throw stiffarmed from the shoulder like there was a pivot there for it to turn on like a girl not from the wrist and elbow with your arm out to one side like a boy and mind you when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart she dont clap them together the way you did when you catched the lump of lead why i spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle and i contrived the other things just to make certain now trot along to your uncle sarah mary williams george elexander peters and if you get into trouble you send word to mrs judith loftus which is me and ill do what i can to get you out of it keep the river road all the way and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you the river roads a rocky one and your feetll be in a condition when you get to goshen i reckon i went up the bank about fifty yards and then i doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was a good piece below the house i jumped in and was off in a hurry i went upstream far enough to make the head of the island and then started across i took off the sunbonnet for i didnt want no blinders on then when i was about the middle i heard the clock begin to strike so i stops and listens the sound come faint over the water but cleareleven when i struck the head of the island i never waited to blow though i was most winded but i shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot then i jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place a mile and a half below as hard as i could go i landed and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern there jim laid sound asleep on the ground i roused him out and says git up and hump yourself jim there aint a minute to lose theyre after us jim never asked no questions he never said a word but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared by that time everything we had in the world was on our raft and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid we put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing and didnt show a candle outside after that i took the canoe out from the shore a little piece and took a look but if there was a boat around i couldnt see it for stars and shadows aint good to see by then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade past the foot of the island dead stillnever saying a word chapter xii it must a been close on to one oclock when we got below the island at last and the raft did seem to go mighty slow if a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the illinois shore and it was well a boat didnt come for we hadnt ever thought to put the gun in the canoe or a fishingline or anything to eat we was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things it warnt good judgment to put everything on the raft if the men went to the island i just expect they found the camp fire i built and watched it all night for jim to come anyways they stayed away from us and if my building the fire never fooled them it warnt no fault of mine i played it as low down on them as i could when the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the illinois side and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cavein in the bank there a towhead is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrowteeth we had mountains on the missouri shore and heavy timber on the illinois side and the channel was down the missouri shore at that place so we warnt afraid of anybody running across us we laid there all day and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the missouri shore and upbound steamboats fight the big river in the middle i told jim all about the time i had jabbering with that woman and jim said she was a smart one and if she was to start after us herself she wouldnt set down and watch a camp fireno sir shed fetch a dog well then i said why couldnt she tell her husband to fetch a dog jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start and he believed they must a gone uptown to get a dog and so they lost all that time or else we wouldnt be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the villageno indeedy we would be in that same old town again so i said i didnt care what was the reason they didnt get us as long as they didnt when it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket and looked up and down and across nothing in sight so jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy and to keep the things dry jim made a floor for the wigwam and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly the wigwam would keep it from being seen we made an extra steeringoar too because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something we fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming downstream to keep from getting run over but we wouldnt have to light it for upstream boats unless we see we was in what they call a crossing for the river was pretty high yet very low banks being still a little under water so upbound boats didnt always run the channel but hunted easy water this second night we run between seven and eight hours with a current that was making over four mile an hour we catched fish and talked and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness it was kind of solemn drifting down the big still river laying on our backs looking up at the stars and we didnt ever feel like talking loud and it warnt often that we laughedonly a little kind of a low chuckle we had mighty good weather as a general thing and nothing ever happened to us at allthat night nor the next nor the next every night we passed towns some of them away up on black hillsides nothing but just a shiny bed of lights not a house could you see the fifth night we passed st louis and it was like the whole world lit up in st petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in st louis but i never believed it till i see that wonderful spread of lights at two oclock that still night there warnt a sound there everybody was asleep every night now i used to slip ashore towards ten oclock at some little village and buy ten or fifteen cents worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat and sometimes i lifted a chicken that warnt roosting comfortable and took him along pap always said take a chicken when you get a chance because if you dont want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does and a good deed aint ever forgot i never see pap when he didnt want the chicken himself but that is what he used to say anyway mornings before daylight i slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon or a mushmelon or a punkin or some new corn or things of that kind pap always said it warnt no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time but the widow said it warnt anything but a soft name for stealing and no decent body would do it jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we wouldnt borrow them any morethen he reckoned it wouldnt be no harm to borrow the others so we talked it over all one night drifting along down the river trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons or the cantelopes or the mushmelons or what but towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory and concluded to drop crabapples and psimmons we warnt feeling just right before that but it was all comfortable now i was glad the way it come out too because crabapples aint ever good and the psimmons wouldnt be ripe for two or three months yet we shot a waterfowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or didnt go to bed early enough in the evening take it all round we lived pretty high the fifth night below st louis we had a big storm after midnight with a power of thunder and lightning and the rain poured down in a solid sheet we stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself when the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead and high rocky bluffs on both sides by and by says i hello jim looky yonder it was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock we was drifting straight down for her the lightning showed her very distinct she was leaning over with part of her upper deck above water and you could see every little chimblyguy clean and clear and a chair by the big bell with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it when the flashes come well it being away in the night and stormy and all so mysteriouslike i felt just the way any other boy would a felt when i see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river i wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little and see what there was there so i says les land on her jim but jim was dead against it at first he says i doan want to go fooln long er no wrack wes doin blame well en we better let blame well alone as de good book says like as not deys a watchman on dat wrack watchman your grandmother i says there aint nothing to watch but the texas and the pilothouse and do you reckon anybodys going to resk his life for a texas and a pilothouse such a night as this when its likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute jim couldnt say nothing to that so he didnt try and besides i says we might borrow something worth having out of the captains stateroom seegars i bet youand cost five cents apiece solid cash steamboat captains is always rich and get sixty dollars a month and they dont care a cent what a thing costs you know long as they want it stick a candle in your pocket i cant rest jim till we give her a rummaging do you reckon tom sawyer would ever go by this thing not for pie he wouldnt hed call it an adventurethats what hed call it and hed land on that wreck if it was his last act and wouldnt he throw style into it wouldnt he spread himself nor nothing why youd think it was christopher clumbus discovering kingdomcome i wish tom sawyer was here jim he grumbled a little but give in he said we mustnt talk any more than we could help and then talk mighty low the lightning showed us the wreck again just in time and we fetched the stabboard derrick and made fast there the deck was high out here we went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard in the dark towards the texas feeling our way slow with our feet and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys for it was so dark we couldnt see no sign of them pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight and clumb on to it and the next step fetched us in front of the captains door which was open and by jimminy away down through the texashall we see a light and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick and told me to come along i says all right and was going to start for the raft but just then i heard a voice wail out and say oh please dont boys i swear i wont ever tell another voice said pretty loud its a lie jim turner youve acted this way before you always want moren your share of the truck and youve always got it too because youve swore t if you didnt youd tell but this time youve said it jest one time too many youre the meanest treacherousest hound in this country by this time jim was gone for the raft i was just abiling with curiosity and i says to myself tom sawyer wouldnt back out now and so i wont either im agoing to see whats going on here so i dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage and crept aft in the dark till there warnt but one stateroom betwixt me and the crosshall of the texas then in there i see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot and two men standing over him and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand and the other one had a pistol this one kept pointing the pistol at the mans head on the floor and saying id like to and i orter tooa mean skunk the man on the floor would shrivel up and say oh please dont bill i haint ever goin to tell and every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say deed you aint you never said no truer thing n that you bet you and once he said hear him beg and yit if we hadnt got the best of him and tied him hed a killed us both and what for jist for nothn jist because we stood on our rightsthats what for but i lay you aint agoin to threaten nobody any more jim turner put up that pistol bill bill says i dont want to jake packard im for killin himand didnt he kill old hatfield jist the same wayand dont he deserve it but i dont want him killed and ive got my reasons for it bless yo heart for them words jake packard ill never forgit you longs i live says the man on the floor sort of blubbering packard didnt take no notice of that but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where i was there in the dark and motioned bill to come i crawfished as fast as i could about two yards but the boat slanted so that i couldnt make very good time so to keep from getting run over and catched i crawled into a stateroom on the upper side the man came apawing along in the dark and when packard got to my stateroom he says herecome in here and in he come and bill after him but before they got in i was up in the upper berth cornered and sorry i come then they stood there with their hands on the ledge of the berth and talked i couldnt see them but i could tell where they was by the whisky theyd been having i was glad i didnt drink whisky but it wouldnt made much difference anyway because most of the time they couldnt a treed me because i didnt breathe i was too scared and besides a body couldnt breathe and hear such talk they talked low and earnest bill wanted to kill turner he says hes said hell tell and he will if we was to give both our shares to him now it wouldnt make no difference after the row and the way weve served him shores youre born hell turn states evidence now you hear me im for putting him out of his troubles som i says packard very quiet blame it id sorter begun to think you wasnt well then thats all right les go and do it hold on a minute i haint had my say yit you listen to me shootings good but theres quieter ways if the things got to be done but what i say is this it aint good sense to go courtn around after a halter if you can git at what youre up to in some way thats jist as good and at the same time dont bring you into no resks aint that so you bet it is but how you goin to manage it this time well my idea is this well rustle around and gather up whatever pickins weve overlooked in the staterooms and shove for shore and hide the truck then well wait now i say it aint agoin to be moren two hours befo this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river see hell be drownded and wont have nobody to blame for it but his own self i reckon thats a considerble sight better n killin of him im unfavorable to killin a man as long as you can git aroun it it aint good sense it aint good morals aint i right yes i reckn you are but spose she dont break up and wash off well we can wait the two hours anyway and see cant we all right then come along so they started and i lit out all in a cold sweat and scrambled forward it was dark as pitch there but i said in a kind of a coarse whisper jim and he answered up right at my elbow with a sort of a moan and i says quick jim it aint no time for fooling around and moaning theres a gang of murderers in yonder and if we dont hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows cant get away from the wreck theres one of em going to be in a bad fix but if we find their boat we can put all of em in a bad fixfor the sheriff ll get em quickhurry ill hunt the labboard side you hunt the stabboard you start at the raft and oh my lordy lordy raf dey ain no raf no mo she done broke loose en gone ien here we is chapter xiii well i catched my breath and most fainted shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that but it warnt no time to be sentimentering wed got to find that boat nowhad to have it for ourselves so we went aquaking and shaking down the stabboard side and slow work it was tooseemed a week before we got to the stern no sign of a boat jim said he didnt believe he could go any furtherso scared he hadnt hardly any strength left he said but i said come on if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix sure so on we prowled again we struck for the stern of the texas and found it and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight hanging on from shutter to shutter for the edge of the skylight was in the water when we got pretty close to the crosshall door there was the skiff sure enough i could just barely see her i felt ever so thankful in another second i would a been aboard of her but just then the door opened one of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me and i thought i was gone but he jerked it in again and says heave that blame lantern out o sight bill he flung a bag of something into the boat and then got in himself and set down it was packard then bill he come out and got in packard says in a low voice all readyshove off i couldnt hardly hang on to the shutters i was so weak but bill says hold ond you go through him no didnt you no so hes got his share o the cash yet well then come along no use to take truck and leave money say wont he suspicion what were up to maybe he wont but we got to have it anyway come along so they got out and went in the door slammed to because it was on the careened side and in a half second i was in the boat and jim come tumbling after me i out with my knife and cut the rope and away we went we didnt touch an oar and we didnt speak nor whisper nor hardly even breathe we went gliding swift along dead silent past the tip of the paddlebox and past the stern then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck and the darkness soaked her up every last sign of her and we was safe and knowed it when we was three or four hundred yards downstream we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as jim turner was then jim manned the oars and we took out after our raft now was the first time that i begun to worry about the meni reckon i hadnt had time to before i begun to think how dreadful it was even for murderers to be in such a fix i says to myself there aint no telling but i might come to be a murderer myself yet and then how would i like it so says i to jim the first light we see well land a hundred yards below it or above it in a place where its a good hidingplace for you and the skiff and then ill go and fix up some kind of a yarn and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape so they can be hung when their time comes but that idea was a failure for pretty soon it begun to storm again and this time worse than ever the rain poured down and never a light showed everybody in bed i reckon we boomed along down the river watching for lights and watching for our raft after a long time the rain let up but the clouds stayed and the lightning kept whimpering and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead floating and we made for it it was the raft and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again we seen a light now away down to the right on shore so i said i would go for it the skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck we hustled it on to the raft in a pile and i told jim to float along down and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile and keep it burning till i come then i manned my oars and shoved for the light as i got down towards it three or four more showedup on a hillside it was a village i closed in above the shore light and laid on my oars and floated as i went by i see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a doublehull ferryboat i skimmed around for the watchman awondering whereabouts he slept and by and by i found him roosting on the bitts forward with his head down between his knees i gave his shoulder two or three little shoves and begun to cry he stirred up in a kind of a startlish way but when he see it was only me he took a good gap and stretch and then he says hello whats up dont cry bub whats the trouble i says pap and mam and sis and then i broke down he says oh dang it now dont take on so we all has to have our troubles and this n ll come out all right whats the matter with em theyretheyreare you the watchman of the boat yes he says kind of prettywellsatisfied like im the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deckhand and sometimes im the freight and passengers i aint as rich as old jim hornback and i cant be so blame generous and good to tom dick and harry as what he is and slam around money the way he does but ive told him a many a time t i wouldnt trade places with him for says i a sailors lifes the life for me and im derned if id live two mile out o town where there aint nothing ever goin on not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it says i i broke in and says theyre in an awful peck of trouble and who is why pap and mam and sis and miss hooker and if youd take your ferryboat and go up there up where where are they on the wreck what wreck why there aint but one what you dont mean the walter scott yes good land what are they doin there for gracious sakes well they didnt go there apurpose i bet they didnt why great goodness there aint no chance for em if they dont git off mighty quick why how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape easy enough miss hooker was avisiting up there to the town yes booths landinggo on she was avisiting there at booths landing and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horseferry to stay all night at her friends house miss whatyoumaycallher i disremember her nameand they lost their steeringoar and swung around and went afloating down stern first about two mile and saddlebaggsed on the wreck and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost but miss hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck well about an hour after dark we come along down in our tradingscow and it was so dark we didnt notice the wreck till we was right on it and so we saddlebaggsed but all of us was saved but bill whippleand oh he was the best creturi most wish t it had been me i do my george its the beatenest thing i ever struck and then what did you all do well we hollered and took on but its so wide there we couldnt make nobody hear so pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow i was the only one that could swim so i made a dash for it and miss hooker she said if i didnt strike help sooner come here and hunt up her uncle and hed fix the thing i made the land about a mile below and been fooling along ever since trying to get people to do something but they said what in such a night and such a current there aint no sense in it go for the steam ferry now if youll go and by jackson id like to and blame it i dont know but i will but who in the dingnations agoing to pay for it do you reckon your pap why thats all right miss hooker she tole me particular that her uncle hornback great guns is he her uncle looky here you break for that light over yonderway and turn out west when you git there and about a quarter of a mile out youll come to the tavern tell em to dart you out to jim hornbacks and hell foot the bill and dont you fool around any because hell want to know the news tell him ill have his niece all safe before he can get to town hump yourself now im agoing up around the corner here to roust out my engineer i struck for the light but as soon as he turned the corner i went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards and tucked myself in among some woodboats for i couldnt rest easy till i could see the ferryboat start but take it all around i was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang for not many would a done it i wished the widow knowed about it i judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in well before long here comes the wreck dim and dusky sliding along down a kind of cold shiver went through me and then i struck out for her she was very deep and i see in a minute there warnt much chance for anybody being alive in her i pulled all around her and hollered a little but there wasnt any answer all dead still i felt a little bit heavyhearted about the gang but not much for i reckoned if they could stand it i could then here comes the ferryboat so i shoved for the middle of the river on a long downstream slant and when i judged i was out of eyereach i laid on my oars and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for miss hookers remainders because the captain would know her uncle hornback would want them and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore and i laid into my work and went abooming down the river it did seem a powerful long time before jims light showed up and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off by the time i got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east so we struck for an island and hid the raft and sunk the skiff and turned in and slept like dead people chapter xiv by and by when we got up we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck and found boots and blankets and clothes and all sorts of other things and a lot of books and a spyglass and three boxes of seegars we hadnt ever been this rich before in neither of our lives the seegars was prime we laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking and me reading the books and having a general good time i told jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat and i said these kinds of things was adventures but he said he didnt want no more adventures he said that when i went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died because he judged it was all up with him anyway it could be fixed for if he didnt get saved he would get drownded and if he did get saved whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward and then miss watson would sell him south sure well he was right he was most always right he had an uncommon level head for a nigger i read considerable to jim about kings and dukes and earls and such and how gaudy they dressed and how much style they put on and called each other your majesty and your grace and your lordship and so on stead of mister and jims eyes bugged out and he was interested he says i didn know dey was so many un um i haint hearn

it warnt no use wasting wordsyou cant learn a nigger to argue so i quit chapter xv we judged that three nights more would fetch us to cairo at the bottom of illinois where the ohio river comes in and that was what we was after we would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the ohio amongst the free states and then be out of trouble well the second night a fog begun to come on and we made for a towhead to tie to for it wouldnt do to try to run in a fog but when i paddled ahead in the canoe with the line to make fast there warnt anything but little saplings to tie to i passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank but there was a stiff current and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went i see the fog closing down and it made me so sick and scared i couldnt budge for most a half a minute it seemed to meand then there warnt no raft in sight you couldnt see twenty yards i jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke but she didnt come i was in such a hurry i hadnt untied her i got up and tried to untie her but i was so excited my hands shook so i couldnt hardly do anything with them as soon as i got started i took out after the raft hot and heavy right down the towhead that was all right as far as it went but the towhead warnt sixty yards long and the minute i flew by the foot of it i shot out into the solid white fog and hadnt no more idea which way i was going than a dead man thinks i it wont do to paddle first i know ill run into the bank or a towhead or something i got to set still and float and yet its mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time i whooped and listened away down there somewheres i hears a small whoop and up comes my spirits i went tearing after it listening sharp to hear it again the next time it come i see i warnt heading for it but heading away to the right of it and the next time i was heading away to the left of itand not gaining on it much either for i was flying around this way and that and tother but it was going straight ahead all the time i did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan and beat it all the time but he never did and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me well i fought along and directly i hears the whoop behind me i was tangled good now that was somebody elses whoop or else i was turned around i throwed the paddle down i heard the whoop again it was behind me yet but in a different place it kept coming and kept changing its place and i kept answering till by and by it was in front of me again and i knowed the current had swung the canoes head downstream and i was all right if that was jim and not some other raftsman hollering i couldnt tell nothing about voices in a fog for nothing dont look natural nor sound natural in a fog the whooping went on and in about a minute i come abooming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared the currrent was tearing by them so swift in another second or two it was solid white and still again i set perfectly still then listening to my heart thump and i reckon i didnt draw a breath while it thumped a hundred i just give up then i knowed what the matter was that cut bank was an island and jim had gone down tother side of it it warnt no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes it had the big timber of a regular island it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide i kept quiet with my ears cocked about fifteen minutes i reckon i was floating along of course four or five miles an hour but you dont ever think of that no you feel like you are laying dead still on the water and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you dont think to yourself how fast youre going but you catch your breath and think my how that snags tearing along if you think it aint dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night you try it onceyoull see next for about a half an hour i whoops now and then at last i hears the answer a long ways off and tries to follow it but i couldnt do it and directly i judged id got into a nest of towheads for i had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of mesometimes just a narrow channel between and some that i couldnt see i knowed was there because id hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks well i warnt long loosing the whoops down amongst the towheads and i only tried to chase them a little while anyway because it was worse than chasing a jackolantern you never knowed a sound dodge around so and swap places so quick and so much i had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times to keep from knocking the islands out of the river and so i judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearingit was floating a little faster than what i was well i seemed to be in the open river again by and by but i couldnt hear no sign of a whoop nowheres i reckoned jim had fetched up on a snag maybe and it was all up with him i was good and tired so i laid down in the canoe and said i wouldnt bother no more i didnt want to go to sleep of course but i was so sleepy i couldnt help it so i thought i would take jest one little catnap but i reckon it was more than a catnap for when i waked up the stars was shining bright the fog was all gone and i was spinning down a big bend stern first first i didnt know where i was i thought i was dreaming and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week it was a monstrous big river here with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks just a solid wall as well as i could see by the stars i looked away downstream and seen a black speck on the water i took after it but when i got to it it warnt nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together then i see another speck and chased that then another and this time i was right it was the raft when i got to it jim was setting there with his head down between his knees asleep with his right arm hanging over the steeringoar the other oar was smashed off and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt so shed had a rough time i made fast and laid down under jims nose on the raft and began to gap and stretch my fists out against jim and says hello jim have i been asleep why didnt you stir me up goodness gracious is dat you huck en you ain deadyou ain drowndedyous back agin its too good for true honey its too good for true lemme look at you chile lemme feel o you no you ain dead yous back agin live en soun jis de same ole huckde same ole huck thanks to goodness whats the matter with you jim you been adrinking drinkin has i ben adrinkin has i had a chance to be

look me in de eye haint you ben gone away gone away why what in the nation do you mean i haint been gone anywheres where would i go to well looky here boss deys sumfn wrong dey is is i me or who is i

de canoe fer to make fas to de towhead no i didnt what towhead i haint see no towhead you haint seen no towhead looky here didnt de line pull loose en de raf go ahummin down de river en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog what fog why de fogde fog dats been aroun all night en didnt you whoop en didnt i whoop tell we got mix up in de islands en one un us got los en tother one was jis as good as los kase he didn know whah he wuz en didnt i bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos git drownded now ain dat so bossaint it so you answer me dat well this is too many for me jim i haint seen no fog nor no islands nor no troubles nor nothing i been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago and i reckon i done the same you couldnt a got drunk in that time so of course youve been dreaming dad fetch it how is i gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes well hang it all you did dream it because there didnt any of it happen but huck its all jis as plain to me as it dont make no difference how plain it is there aint nothing in it i know because ive been here all the time jim didnt say nothing for about five minutes but set there studying over it then he says well den i reckn i did dream it huck but dog my cats ef it aint de powerfullest dream i ever see en i haint ever had no dream bfo dats tired me like dis one oh well thats all right because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes but this one was a staving dream tell me all about it jim so jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through just as it happened only he painted it up considerable then he said he must start in and terpret it because it was sent for a warning he said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good but the current was another man that would get us away from him the whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then and if we didnt try hard to make out to understand them theyd just take us into bad luck stead of keeping us out of it the lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks but if we minded our business and didnt talk back and aggravate them we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river which was the free states and wouldnt have no more trouble it had clouded up pretty dark just after i got on to the raft but it was clearing up again now oh well thats all interpreted well enough as far as it goes jim i says but what does these things stand for it was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar you could see them firstrate now jim looked at the trash and then looked at me and back at the trash again he had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldnt seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away but when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling and says what do dey stan for ise gwyne to tell you when i got all wore out wid work en wid de callin for you en went to sleep my heart wuz mos broke bekase you wuz los en i didn kyer no mo what become er me en de raf en when i wake up en fine you back agin all safe en soun de tears come en i could a got down on my knees en kiss yo foot is so thankful en all you wuz thinkin bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole jim wid a lie dat truck dah is trash en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey frens en makes em ashamed then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam and went in there without saying anything but that but that was enough it made me feel so mean i could almost kissed his foot to get him to take it back it was fifteen minutes before i could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger but i done it and i warnt ever sorry for it afterwards neither i didnt do him no more mean tricks and i wouldnt done that one if id a knowed it would make him feel that way chapter xvi we slept most all day and started out at night a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession she had four long sweeps at each end so we judged she carried as many as thirty men likely she had five big wigwams aboard wide apart and an open camp fire in the middle and a tall flagpole at each end there was a power of style about her it amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that we went drifting down into a big bend and the night clouded up and got hot the river was very wide and was walled with solid timber on both sides you couldnt see a break in it hardly ever or a light we talked about cairo and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it i said likely we wouldnt because i had heard say there warnt but about a dozen houses there and if they didnt happen to have them lit up how was we going to know we was passing a town jim said if the two big rivers joined together there that would show but i said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again that disturbed jimand me too so the question was what to do i said paddle ashore the first time a light showed and tell them pap was behind coming along with a tradingscow and was a green hand at the business and wanted to know how far it was to cairo jim thought it was a good idea so we took a smoke on it and waited there warnt nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town and not pass it without seeing it he said hed be mighty sure to see it because hed be a free man the minute he seen it but if he missed it hed be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom every little while he jumps up and says dah she is but it warnt it was jackolanterns or lightning bugs so he set down again and went to watching same as before jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom well i can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish too to hear him because i begun to get it through my head that he was most freeand who was to blame for it why me i couldnt get that out of my conscience no how nor no way it got to troubling me so i couldnt rest i couldnt stay still in one place it hadnt ever come home to me before what this thing was that i was doing but now it did and it stayed with me and scorched me more and more i tried to make out to myself that i warnt to blame because i didnt run jim off from his rightful owner but it warnt no use conscience up and says every time but you knowed he was running for his freedom and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody that was soi couldnt get around that noway that was where it pinched conscience says to me what had poor miss watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word what did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean why she tried to learn you your book she tried to learn you your manners she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how thats what she done i got to feeling so mean and so miserable i most wished i was dead i fidgeted up and down the raft abusing myself to myself and jim was fidgeting up and down past me we neither of us could keep still every time he danced around and says dahs cairo it went through me like a shot and i thought if it was cairo i reckoned i would die of miserableness jim talked out loud all the time while i was talking to myself he was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free state he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent and when he got enough he would buy his wife which was owned on a farm close to where miss watson lived and then they would both work to buy the two children and if their master wouldnt sell them theyd get an ablitionist to go and steal them it most froze me to hear such talk he wouldnt ever dared to talk such talk in his life before just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free it was according to the old saying give a nigger an inch and hell take an ell thinks i this is what comes of my not thinking here was this nigger which i had as good as helped to run away coming right out flatfooted and saying he would steal his childrenchildren that belonged to a man i didnt even know a man that hadnt ever done me no harm i was sorry to hear jim say that it was such a lowering of him my conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever until at last i says to it let up on meit aint too late yetill paddle ashore at the first light and tell i felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off all my troubles was gone i went to looking out sharp for a light and sort of singing to myself by and by one showed jim sings out wes safe huck wes safe jump up and crack yo heels dats de good ole cairo at las i jis knows it i says ill take the canoe and go and see jim it mightnt be you know he jumped and got the canoe ready and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on and give me the paddle and as i shoved off he says pooty soon ill be ashoutn for joy en ill say its all on accounts o huck is a free man en i couldnt ever ben free ef it hadn ben for huck huck done it jim wont ever forgit you huck yous de bes fren jims ever had en yous de only fren ole jims got now i was paddling off all in a sweat to tell on him but when he says this it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me i went along slow then and i warnt right down certain whether i was glad i started or whether i warnt when i was fifty yards off jim says dah you goes de ole true huck de ony white genlman dat ever kep his promise to ole jim well i just felt sick but i says i got to do iti cant get out of it right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns and they stopped and i stopped one of them says whats that yonder a piece of a raft i says do you belong on it yes sir any men on it only one sir well theres five niggers run off tonight up yonder above the head of the bend is your man white or black i didnt answer up prompt i tried to but the words wouldnt come i tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it but i warnt man enoughhadnt the spunk of a rabbit i see i was weakening so i just give up trying and up and says hes white i reckon well go and see for ourselves i wish you would says i because its pap thats there and maybe youd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is hes sickand so is mam and mary ann oh the devil were in a hurry boy but i spose weve got to come buckle to your paddle and lets get along i buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars when we had made a stroke or two i says papll be mighty much obleeged to you i can tell you everybody goes away when i want them to help me tow the raft ashore and i cant do it by myself well thats infernal mean odd too say boy whats the matter with your father its theathewell it aint anything much they stopped pulling it warnt but a mighty little ways to the raft now one says boy thats a lie what is the matter with your pap answer up square now and itll be the better for you i will sir i will honestbut dont leave us please its thethe gentlemen if youll only pull ahead and let me heave you the headline you wont have to come anear the raftplease do set her back john set her back says one they backed water keep away boykeep to looard confound it i just expect the wind has blowed it to us your paps got the smallpox and you know it precious well why didnt you come out and say so do you want to spread it all over well says i ablubbering ive told everybody before and they just went away and left us poor devil theres something in that we are right down sorry for you but wewell hang it we dont want the smallpox you see look here ill tell you what to do dont you try to land by yourself or youll smash everything to pieces you float along down about twenty miles and youll come to a town on the lefthand side of the river it will be long after sunup then and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever dont be a fool again and let people guess what is the matter now were trying to do you a kindness so you just put twenty miles between us thats a good boy it wouldnt do any good to land yonder where the light isits only a woodyard say i reckon your fathers poor and im bound to say hes in pretty hard luck here ill put a twentydollar gold piece on this board and you get it when it floats by i feel mighty mean to leave you but my kingdom it wont do to fool with smallpox dont you see hold on parker says the other

and you can make some money by it goodbye sir says i i wont let no runaway niggers get by me if i can help it they went off and i got aboard the raft feeling bad and low because i knowed very well i had done wrong and i see it warnt no use for me to try to learn to do right a body that dont get started right when hes little aint got no showwhen the pinch comes there aint nothing to back him up and keep him to his work and so he gets beat then i thought a minute and says to myself hold on spose youd a done right and give jim up would you felt better than what you do now no says i id feel badid feel just the same way i do now well then says i whats the use you learning to do right when its troublesome to do right and aint no trouble to do wrong and the wages is just the same i was stuck i couldnt answer that so i reckoned i wouldnt bother no more about it but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time i went into the wigwam jim warnt there i looked all around he warnt anywhere i says jim here i is huck is dey out o sight yit dont talk loud he was in the river under the stern oar with just his nose out i told him they were out of sight so he come aboard he says i was alistenin to all de talk en i slips into de river en was gwyne to shove for sho if dey come aboard den i was gwyne to swim to de raf agin when dey was gone but lawsy how you did fool em huck dat wuz de smartes dodge i tell you chile ispec it save ole jimole jim aint going to forgit you for dat honey then we talked about the money it was a pretty good raisetwenty dollars apiece jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free states he said twenty mile more warnt far for the raft to go but he wished we was already there towards daybreak we tied up and jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good then he worked all day fixing things in bundles and getting all ready to quit rafting that night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a lefthand bend i went off in the canoe to ask about it pretty soon i found a man out in the river with a skiff setting a trotline i ranged up and says mister is that town cairo cairo no you must be a blame fool what town is it mister if you want to know go and find out if you stay here botherin around me for about a half a minute longer youll get something you wont want i paddled to the raft jim was awful disappointed but i said never mind cairo would be the next place i reckoned we passed another town before daylight and i was going out again but it was high ground so i didnt go no high ground about cairo jim said i had forgot it we laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the lefthand bank i begun to suspicion something so did jim i says maybe we went by cairo in the fog that night he says doan les talk about it huck po niggers cant have no luck i awluz spected dat rattlesnakeskin warnt done wid its work i wish id never seen that snakeskin jimi do wish id never laid eyes on it it aint yo fault huck you didn know dont you blame yoself bout it when it was daylight here was the clear ohio water inshore sure enough and outside was the old regular muddy so it was all up with cairo we talked it all over it wouldnt do to take to the shore we couldnt take the raft up the stream of course there warnt no way but to wait for dark and start back in the canoe and take the chances so we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket so as to be fresh for the work and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone we didnt say a word for a good while there warnt anything to say we both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnakeskin so what was the use to talk about it it would only look like we was finding fault and that would be bound to fetch more bad luckand keep on fetching it too till we knowed enough to keep still by and by we talked about what we better do and found there warnt no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in we warnt going to borrow it when there warnt anybody around the way pap would do for that might set people after us so we shoved out after dark on the raft anybody that dont believe yet that its foolishness to handle a snakeskin after all that that snakeskin done for us will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us the place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore but we didnt see no rafts laying up so we went along during three hours and more well the night got gray and ruther thick which is the next meanest thing to fog you cant tell the shape of the river and you cant see no distance it got to be very late and still and then along comes a steamboat up the river we lit the lantern and judged she would see it upstream boats didnt generly come close to us they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river we could hear her pounding along but we didnt see her good till she was close she aimed right for us often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs and thinks hes mighty smart well here she comes and we said she was going to try and shave us but she didnt seem to be sheering off a bit she was a big one and she was coming in a hurry too looking like a black cloud with rows of glowworms around it but all of a sudden she bulged out big and scary with a long row of wideopen furnace doors shining like redhot teeth and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us there was a yell at us and a jingling of bells to stop the engines a powwow of cussing and whistling of steamand as jim went overboard on one side and i on the other she come smashing straight through the raft i divedand i aimed to find the bottom too for a thirtyfoot wheel had got to go over me and i wanted it to have plenty of room i could always stay under water a minute this time i reckon i stayed under a minute and a half then i bounced for the top in a hurry for i was nearly busting i popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose and puffed a bit of course there was a booming current and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them for they never cared much for raftsmen so now she was churning along up the river out of sight in the thick weather though i could hear her i sung out for jim about a dozen times but i didnt get any answer so i grabbed a plank that touched me while i was treading water and struck out for shore shoving it ahead of me but i made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the lefthand shore which meant that i was in a crossing so i changed off and went that way it was one of these long slanting twomile crossings so i was a good long time in getting over i made a safe landing and clumb up the bank i couldnt see but a little ways but i went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more and then i run across a big oldfashioned double loghouse before i noticed it i was going to rush by and get away but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me and i knowed better than to move another peg chapter xvii in about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out and says be done boys whos there i says its me whos me george jackson sir what do you want i dont want

slow step at a time and there warnt a sound only i thought i could hear my heart the dogs were as still as the humans but they followed a little behind me when i got to the three log doorsteps i heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting i put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said there thats enoughput your head in i done it but i judged they would take it off the candle was on the floor and there they all was looking at me and me at them for about a quarter of a minute three big men with guns pointed at me which made me wince i tell you the oldest gray and about sixty the other two thirty or moreall of them fine and handsome and the sweetest old grayheaded lady and back of her two young women which i couldnt see right well the old gentleman says there i reckon its all right come in as soon as i was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it and told the young men to come in with their guns and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows there warnt none on the side they held the candle and took a good look at me and all said why he aint a shepherdsonno there aint any shepherdson about him then the old man said he hoped i wouldnt mind being searched for arms because he didnt mean no harm by itit was only to make sure so he didnt pry into my pockets but only felt outside with his hands and said it was all right he told me to make myself easy and at home and tell all about myself but the old lady says why bless you saul the poor things as wet as he can be and dont you reckon it may be hes hungry true for you racheli forgot so the old lady says betsy this was a nigger woman you fly around and get him something to eat as quick as you can poor thing and one of you girls go and wake up buck and tell himoh here he is himself buck take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours thats dry buck looked about as old as methirteen or fourteen or along there though he was a little bigger than me he hadnt on anything but a shirt and he was very frowzyheaded he came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes and he was dragging a gun along with the other one he says aint they no shepherdsons around they said no twas a false alarm well he says if theyd a ben some i reckon id a got one they all laughed and bob says why buck they might have scalped us all youve been so slow in coming well nobody come after me and it aint right im always kept down i dont get no show never mind buck my boy says the old man youll have show enough all in good time dont you fret about that go long with you now and do as your mother told you when we got upstairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a roundabout and pants of his and i put them on while i was at it he asked me what my name was but before i could tell him he started to tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday and he asked me where moses was when the candle went out i said i didnt know i hadnt heard about it before no way well guess he says howm i going to guess says i when i never heard tell of it before but you can guess cant you its just as easy which candle i says why any candle he says i dont know where he was

got to stay always we can just have booming timesthey dont have no school now do you own a dog ive got a dogand hell go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in do you like to comb up sundays and all that kind of foolishness you bet i dont but ma she makes me confound these ole britches i reckon id better put em on but id ruther not its so warm are you all ready all right come along old hoss cold cornpone cold cornbeef butter and buttermilkthat is what they had for me down there and there aint nothing better that ever ive come across yet buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes except the nigger woman which was gone and the two young women they all smoked and talked and i eat and talked the young women had quilts around them and their hair down their backs they all asked me questions and i told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of arkansaw and my sister mary ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more and bill went to hunt them and he warnt heard of no more and tom and mort died and then there warnt nobody but just me and pap left and he was just trimmed down to nothing on account of his troubles so when he died i took what there was left because the farm didnt belong to us and started up the river deck passage and fell overboard and that was how i come to be here so they said i could have a home there as long as i wanted it then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed and i went to bed with buck and when i waked up in the morning drat it all i had forgot what my name was so i laid there about an hour trying to think and when buck waked up i says can you spell buck yes he says i bet you cant spell my name says i i bet you what you dare i can says he all right says i go ahead george jaxonthere now he says well says i you done it but i didnt think you could it aint no slouch of a name to spellright off without studying i set it down private because somebody might want me to spell it next and so i wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like i was used to it it was a mighty nice family and a mighty nice house too i hadnt seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style it didnt have an iron latch on the front door nor a wooden one with a buckskin string but a brass knob to turn the same as houses in town there warnt no bed in the parlor nor a sign of a bed but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them there was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick sometimes they wash them over with red waterpaint that they call spanishbrown same as they do in town they had big brass dogirons that could hold up a sawlog there was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front and a round place in the middle of it for the sun and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it it was beautiful to hear that clock tick and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out they wouldnt took any money for her well there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock made out of something like chalk and painted up gaudy by one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery and a crockery dog by the other and when you pressed down on them they squeaked but didnt open their mouths nor look different nor interested they squeaked through underneath there was a couple of big wildturkeywing fans spread out behind those things on the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is but they warnt real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk or whatever it was underneath this table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth with a red and blue spreadeagle painted on it and a painted border all around it come all the way from philadelphia they said there was some books too piled up perfectly exact on each corner of the table one was a big family bible full of pictures one was pilgrims progress about a man that left his family it didnt say why i read considerable in it now and then the statements was interesting but tough another was friendships offering full of beautiful stuff and poetry but i didnt read the poetry another was henry clays speeches and another was dr gunns family medicine which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead there was a hymn book and a lot of other books and there was nice splitbottom chairs and perfectly sound toonot bagged down in the middle and busted like an old basket they had pictures hung on the wallsmainly washingtons and lafayettes and battles and highland marys and one called signing the declaration there was some that they called crayons which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old they was different from any pictures i ever see before blacker mostly than is common one was a woman in a slim black dress belted small under the armpits with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves and a large black scoopshovel bonnet with a black veil and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape and very wee black slippers like a chisel and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow under a weeping willow and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule and underneath the picture it said shall i never see thee more alas another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head and knotted there in front of a comb like a chairback and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up and underneath the picture it said i shall never hear thy sweet chirrup more alas there was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon and tears running down her cheeks and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth and underneath the picture it said and art thou gone yes thou art gone alas these was all nice pictures i reckon but i didnt somehow seem to take to them because if ever i was down a little they always give me the fantods everybody was sorry she died because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost but i reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard she was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done but she never got the chance it was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off with her hair all down her back and looking up to the moon with the tears running down her face and she had two arms folded across her breast and two arms stretched out in front and two more reaching up towards the moonand the idea was to see which pair would look best and then scratch out all the other arms but as i was saying she died before she got her mind made up and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it other times it was hid with a little curtain the young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery seemed to me this young girl kept a scrapbook when she was alive and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the presbyterian observer and write poetry after them out of her own head it was very good poetry this is what she wrote about a boy by the name of stephen dowling bots that fell down a well and was drownded ode to stephen dowling bots decd and did young stephen sicken and did young stephen die and did the sad hearts thicken and did the mourners cry no such was not the fate of young stephen dowling bots though sad hearts round him thickened twas not from sickness shots no whoopingcough did rack his frame nor measles drear with spots not these impaired the sacred name of stephen dowling bots despised love struck not with woe that head of curly knots nor stomach troubles laid him low young stephen dowling bots o no then list with tearful eye whilst i his fate do tell his soul did from this cold world fly by falling down a well they got him out and emptied him alas it was too late his spirit was gone for to sport aloft in the realms of the good and great if emmeline grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen there aint no telling what she could a done by and by buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing she didnt ever have to stop to think he said she would slap down a line and if she couldnt find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one and go ahead she warnt particular she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful every time a man died or a woman died or a child died she would be on hand with her tribute before he was cold she called them tributes the neighbors said it was the doctor first then emmeline then the undertakerthe undertaker never got in ahead of emmeline but once and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead persons name which was whistler she warnt ever the same after that she never complained but she kinder pined away and did not live long poor thing manys the time i made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrapbook and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and i had soured on her a little i liked all that family dead ones and all and warnt going to let anything come between us poor emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive and it didnt seem right that there warnt nobody to make some about her now she was gone so i tried to sweat out a verse or two myself but i couldnt seem to make it go somehow they kept emmelines room trim and nice and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive and nobody ever slept there the old lady took care of the room herself though there was plenty of niggers and she sewed there a good deal and read her bible there mostly well as i was saying about the parlor there was beautiful curtains on the windows white with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls and cattle coming down to drink there was a little old piano too that had tin pans in it i reckon and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing the last link is broken and play the battle of prague on it the walls of all the rooms was plastered and most had carpets on the floors and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside it was a double house and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day and it was a cool comfortable place nothing couldnt be better and warnt the cooking good and just bushels of it too chapter xviii col grangerford was a gentleman you see he was a gentleman all over and so was his family he was well born as the saying is and thats worth as much in a man as it is in a horse so the widow douglas said and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town and pap he always said it too though he warnt no more quality than a mudcat himself col grangerford was very tall and very slim and had a darkishpaly complexion not a sign of red in it anywheres he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face and he had the thinnest kind of lips and the thinnest kind of nostrils and a high nose and heavy eyebrows and the blackest kind of eyes sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you as you may say his forehead was high and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders his hands was long and thin and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it and on sundays he wore a blue tailcoat with brass buttons on it he carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it there warnt no frivolishness about him not a bit and he warnt ever loud he was as kind as he could beyou could feel that you know and so you had confidence sometimes he smiled and it was good to see but when he straightened himself up like a libertypole and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows you wanted to climb a tree first and find out what the matter was afterwards he didnt ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners everybody was always goodmannered where he was everybody loved to have him around too he was sunshine most alwaysi mean he made it seem like good weather when he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute and that was enough there wouldnt nothing go wrong again for a week when him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them goodday and didnt set down again till they had set down then tom and bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him and he held it in his hand and waited till toms and bobs was mixed and then they bowed and said our duty to you sir and madam and they bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you and so they drank all three and bob and tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers and give it to me and buck and we drank to the old people too bob was the oldest and tom nexttall beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces and long black hair and black eyes they dressed in white linen from head to foot like the old gentleman and wore broad panama hats then there was miss charlotte she was twentyfive and tall and proud and grand but as good as she could be when she warnt stirred up but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks like her father she was beautiful so was her sister miss sophia but it was a different kind she was gentle and sweet like a dove and she was only twenty each person had their own nigger to wait on thembuck too my nigger had a monstrous easy time because i warnt used to having anybody do anything for me but bucks was on the jump most of the time this was all there was of the family now but there used to be more three sons they got killed and emmeline that died the old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers sometimes a stack of people would come there horseback from ten or fifteen mile around and stay five or six days and have such junketings round about and on the river and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes and balls at the house nights these people was mostly kinfolks of the family the men brought their guns with them it was a handsome lot of quality i tell you there was another clan of aristocracy around therefive or six families mostly of the name of shepherdson they was as hightoned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of grangerfords the shepherdsons and grangerfords used the same steamboat landing which was about two mile above our house so sometimes when i went up there with a lot of our folks i used to see a lot of the shepherdsons there on their fine horses one day buck and me was away out in the woods hunting and heard a horse coming we was crossing the road buck says quick jump for the woods we done it and then peeped down the woods through the leaves pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier he had his gun across his pommel i had seen him before it was young harney shepherdson i heard bucks gun go off at my ear and harneys hat tumbled off from his head he grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid but we didnt wait we started through the woods on a run the woods warnt thick so i looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet and twice i seen harney cover buck with his gun and then he rode away the way he cometo get his hat i reckon but i couldnt see we never stopped running till we got home the old gentlemans eyes blazed a minutetwas pleasure mainly i judgedthen his face sort of smoothed down and he says kind of gentle i dont like that shooting from behind a bush why didnt you step into the road my boy the shepherdsons dont father they always take advantage miss charlotte she held her head up like a queen while buck was telling his tale and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped the two young men looked dark but never said nothing miss sophia she turned pale but the color come back when she found the man warnt hurt soon as i could get buck down by the corncribs under the trees by ourselves i says did you want to kill him buck well i bet i did what did he do to you him he never done nothing to me well then what did you want to kill him for why nothingonly its on account of the feud whats a feud why where was you raised dont you know what a feud is never heard of it beforetell me about it well says buck a feud is this way a man has a quarrel with another man and kills him then that other mans brother kills him then the other brothers on both sides goes for one another then the cousins chip inand by and by everybodys killed off and there aint no more feud but its kind of slow and takes a long time has this one been going on long buck well i should reckon it started thirty year ago or somers along there there was trouble bout something and then a lawsuit to settle it and the suit went agin one of the men and so he up and shot the man that won the suitwhich he would naturally do of course anybody would what was the trouble about buckland i reckon maybei dont know well who done the shooting was it a grangerford or a shepherdson laws how do i know it was so long ago dont anybody know oh yes pa knows i reckon and some of the other old people but they dont know now what the row was about in the first place has there been many killed buck yes right smart chance of funerals but they dont always kill pas got a few buckshot in him but he dont mind it cuz he dont weigh much anyway bobs been carved up some with a bowie and toms been hurt once or twice has anybody been killed this year buck yes we got one and they got one bout three months ago my cousin bud fourteen year old was riding through the woods on tother side of the river and didnt have no weapon with him which was blame foolishness and in a lonesome place he hears a horse acoming behind him and sees old baldy shepherdson alinkin after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair aflying in the wind and stead of jumping off and taking to the brush bud lowed he could outrun him so they had it nip and tuck for five mile or more the old man againing all the time so at last bud seen it warnt any use so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front you know and the old man he rode up and shot him down but he didnt git much chance to enjoy his luck for inside of a week our folks laid him out i reckon that old man was a coward buck i reckon he warnt a coward not by a blame sight there aint a coward amongst them shepherdsonsnot a one and there aint no cowards amongst the grangerfords either why that old man kep up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three grangerfords and come out winner they was all ahorseback he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile and kep his horse before him to stop the bullets but the grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man and peppered away at him and he peppered away at them him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled but the grangerfords had to be fetched homeand one of em was dead and another died the next day no sir if a bodys out hunting for cowards he dont want to fool away any time amongst them shepherdsons becuz they dont breed any of that kind next sunday we all went to church about three mile everybody ahorseback the men took their guns along so did buck and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall the shepherdsons done the same it was pretty ornery preachingall about brotherly love and suchlike tiresomeness but everybody said it was a good sermon and they all talked it over going home and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination and i dont know what all that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest sundays i had run across yet about an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around some in their chairs and some in their rooms and it got to be pretty dull buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep i went up to our room and judged i would take a nap myself i found that sweet miss sophia standing in her door which was next to ours and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft and asked me if i liked her and i said i did and she asked me if i would do something for her and not tell anybody and i said i would then she said shed forgot her testament and left it in the seat at church between two other books and would i slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her and not say nothing to nobody i said i would so i slid out and slipped off up the road and there warnt anybody at the church except maybe a hog or two for there warnt any lock on the door and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summertime because its cool if you notice most folks dont go to church only when theyve got to but a hog is different says i to myself somethings up it aint natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a testament so i give it a shake and out drops a little piece of paper with halfpast two wrote on it with a pencil i ransacked it but couldnt find anything else i couldnt make anything out of that so i put the paper in the book again and when i got home and upstairs there was miss sophia in her door waiting for me she pulled me in and shut the door then she looked in the testament till she found the paper and as soon as she read it she looked glad and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze and said i was the best boy in the world and not to tell anybody she was mighty red in the face for a minute and her eyes lighted up and it made her powerful pretty i was a good deal astonished but when i got my breath i asked her what the paper was about and she asked me if i had read it and i said no and she asked me if i could read writing and i told her no only coarsehand and then she said the paper warnt anything but a bookmark to keep her place and i might go and play now i went off down to the river studying over this thing and pretty soon i noticed that my nigger was following along behind when we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around a second and then comes arunning and says mars jawge if youll come down into de swamp ill show you a whole stack o watermoccasins thinks i thats mighty curious he said that yesterday he oughter know a body dont love watermoccasins enough to go around hunting for them what is he up to anyway so i says all right trot ahead i followed a half a mile then he struck out over the swamp and waded ankle deep as much as another halfmile we come to a little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines and he says you shove right in dah jist a few steps mars jawge dahs whah dey is is seed m befo i dont kyer to see em no mo then he slopped right along and went away and pretty soon the trees hid him i poked into the place aways and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines and found a man laying there asleepand by jings it was my old jim i waked him up and i reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him to see me again but it warnt he nearly cried he was so glad but he warnt surprised said he swum along behind me that night and heard me yell every time but dasnt answer because he

you up in it mars buck he loaded up his gun en lowed hes gwyne to fetch home a shepherdson or bust well deyll be plenty un m dah i reckn en you bet you hell fetch one ef he gits a chanst i took up the river road as hard as i could put by and by i begin to hear guns a good ways off when i come in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands i worked along under the trees and brush till i got to a good place and then i clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach and watched there was a woodrank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree and first i was going to hide behind that but maybe it was luckier i didnt there was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store cussing and yelling and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the woodrank alongside of the steamboat landing but they couldnt come it every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at the two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile so they could watch both ways by and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling they started riding towards the store then up gets one of the boys draws a steady bead over the woodrank and drops one of them out of his saddle all the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store and that minute the two boys started on the run they got half way to the tree i was in before the men noticed then the men see them and jumped on their horses and took out after them they gained on the boys but it didnt do no good the boys had too good a start they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree and slipped in behind it and so they had the bulge on the men again one of the boys was buck and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old the men ripped around awhile and then rode away as soon as they was out of sight i sung out to buck and told him he didnt know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first he was awful surprised he told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again said they was up to some devilment or other wouldnt be gone long i wished i was out of that tree but i dasnt come down buck begun to cry and rip and lowed that him and his cousin joe that was the other young chap would make up for this day yet he said his father and his two brothers was killed and two or three of the enemy said the shepherdsons laid for them in ambush buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relationsthe shepherdsons was too strong for them i asked him what was become of young harney and miss sophia he said theyd got across the river and was safe i was glad of that but the way buck did take on because he didnt manage to kill harney that day he shot at himi haint ever heard anything like it all of a sudden bang bang bang goes three or four gunsthe men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses the boys jumped for the riverboth of them hurtand as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out kill them kill them it made me so sick i most fell out of the tree i aint agoing to tell all that happenedit would make me sick again if i was to do that i wished i hadnt ever come ashore that night to see such things i aint ever going to get shut of themlots of times i dream about them i stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark afraid to come down sometimes i heard guns away off in the woods and twice i seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns so i reckoned the trouble was still agoing on i was mighty downhearted so i made up my mind i wouldnt ever go anear that house again because i reckoned i was to blame somehow i judged that that piece of paper meant that miss sophia was to meet harney somewheres at halfpast two and run off and i judged i ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted and then maybe he would a locked her up and this awful mess wouldnt ever happened when i got down out of the tree i crept along down the river bank a piece and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water and tugged at them till i got them ashore then i covered up their faces and got away as quick as i could i cried a little when i was covering up bucks face for he was mighty good to me it was just dark now i never went near the house but struck through the woods and made for the swamp jim warnt on his island so i tramped off in a hurry for the crick and crowded through the willows redhot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country the raft was gone my souls but i was scared i couldnt get my breath for most a minute then i raised a yell a voice not twentyfive foot from me says good lan is dat you honey doan make no noise it was jims voicenothing ever sounded so good before i run along the bank a piece and got aboard and jim he grabbed me and hugged me he was so glad to see me he says laws bless you chile i uz right down sho yous dead agin jacks been heah he say he reckn yous ben shot kase you didn come home no mo so is jes dis minute a startin de raf down towards de mouf er de crick sos to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as jack comes agin en tells me for certain you is dead lawsy is mighty glad to git you back again honey i says all rightthats mighty good they wont find me and theyll think ive been killed and floated down the rivertheres something up there that ll help them think soso dont you lose no time jim but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can i never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the mississippi then we hung up our signal lantern and judged that we was free and safe once more i hadnt had a bite to eat since yesterday so jim he got out some corndodgers and buttermilk and pork and cabbage and greensthere aint nothing in the world so good when its cooked rightand whilst i eat my supper we talked and had a good time i was powerful glad to get away from the feuds and so was jim to get away from the swamp we said there warnt no home like a raft after all other places do seem so cramped up and smothery but a raft dont you feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft chapter xix two or three days and nights went by i reckon i might say they swum by they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely here is the way we put in the time it was a monstrous big river down theresometimes a mile and a half wide we run nights and laid up and hid daytimes soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied upnearly always in the dead water under a towhead and then cut young cottonwoods and willows and hid the raft with them then we set out the lines next we slid into the river and had a swim so as to freshen up and cool off then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep and watched the daylight come not a sound anywheresperfectly still just like the whole world was asleep only sometimes the bullfrogs acluttering maybe the first thing to see looking away over the water was a kind of dull linethat was the woods on tother side you couldnt make nothing else out then a pale place in the sky then more paleness spreading around then the river softened up away off and warnt black any more but gray you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far awaytrading scows and such things and long black streaks rafts sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking or jumbled up voices it was so still and sounds come so far and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that theres a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way and you see the mist curl up off of the water and the east reddens up and the river and you make out a logcabin in the edge of the woods away on the bank on tother side of the river being a woodyard likely and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres then the nice breeze springs up and comes fanning you from over there so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers but sometimes not that way because theyve left dead fish laying around gars and such and they do get pretty rank and next youve got the full day and everything smiling in the sun and the songbirds just going it a little smoke couldnt be noticed now so we would take some fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast and afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river and kind of lazy along and by and by lazy off to sleep wake up by and by and look to see what done it and maybe see a steamboat coughing along upstream so far off towards the other side you couldnt tell nothing about her only whether she was a sternwheel or sidewheel then for about an hour there wouldnt be nothing to hear nor nothing to seejust solid lonesomeness next youd see a raft sliding by away off yonder and maybe a galoot on it chopping because theyre most always doing it on a raft youd see the axe flash and come down you dont hear nothing you see that axe go up again and by the time its above the mans head then you hear the kchunkit had took all that time to come over the water so we would put in the day lazying around listening to the stillness once there was a thick fog and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldnt run over them a scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughingheard them plain but we couldnt see no sign of them it made you feel crawly it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air jim said he believed it was spirits but i says no spirits wouldnt say dern the dern fog soon as it was night out we shoved when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone and let her float wherever the current wanted her to then we lit the pipes and dangled our legs in the water and talked about all kinds of thingswe was always naked day and night whenever the mosquitoes would let usthe new clothes bucks folks made for me was too good to be comfortable and besides i didnt go much on clothes nohow sometimes wed have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time yonder was the banks and the islands across the water and maybe a sparkwhich was a candle in a cabin window and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or twoon a raft or a scow you know and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts its lovely to live on a raft we had the sky up there all speckled with stars and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened jim he allowed they was made but i allowed they happened i judged it would have took too long to make so many jim said the moon could a laid them well that looked kind of reasonable so i didnt say nothing against it because ive seen a frog lay most as many so of course it could be done we used to watch the stars that fell too and see them streak down jim allowed theyd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again and by and by her waves would get to us a long time after she was gone and joggle the raft a bit and after that you wouldnt hear nothing for you couldnt tell how long except maybe frogs or something after midnight the people on shore went to bed and then for two or three hours the shores was blackno more sparks in the cabin windows these sparks was our clockthe first one that showed again meant morning was coming so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away one morning about daybreak i found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shoreit was only two hundred yardsand paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods to see if i couldnt get some berries just as i was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it i thought i was a goner for whenever anybody was after anybody i judged it was meor maybe jim i was about to dig out from there in a hurry but they was pretty close to me then and sung out and begged me to save their livessaid they hadnt been doing nothing and was being chased for itsaid there was men and dogs acoming they wanted to jump right in but i says dont you do it i dont hear the dogs and horses yet youve got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways then you take to the water and wade down to me and get inthatll throw the dogs off the scent they done it and soon as they was aboard i lit out for our towhead and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off shouting we heard them come along towards the crick but couldnt see them they seemed to stop and fool around a while then as we got further and further away all the time we couldnt hardly hear them at all by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river everything was quiet and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe one of these fellows was about seventy or upwards and had a bald head and very gray whiskers he had an old batteredup slouch hat on and a greasy blue woollen shirt and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boottops and homeknit gallusesno he only had one he had an old longtailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm and both of them had big fat rattylooking carpetbags the other fellow was about thirty and dressed about as ornery after breakfast we all laid off and talked and the first thing that come out was that these chaps didnt know one another what got you into trouble says the baldhead to tother chap well id been selling an article to take the tartar off the teethand it does take it off too and generly the enamel along with itbut i stayed about one night longer than i ought to and was just in the act of sliding out when i ran across you on the trail

baldhead to think i should have lived to be leading such a life and be degraded down into such company and he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag dern your skin aint the company good enough for you says the baldhead pretty pert and uppish yes it is good enough for me its as good as i deserve for who fetched me so low when i was so high i did myself i dont blame you gentlemenfar from it i

righti dont make any moan brought you down from whar whar was you brought down from ah you would not believe me the world never believeslet it pass tis no matter the secret of my birth the secret of your birth do you mean to say gentlemen says the young man very solemn i will reveal it to you for i feel i may have confidence in you by rights i am a duke jims eyes bugged out when he heard that and i reckon mine did too then the baldhead says no you cant mean it yes my greatgrandfather eldest son of the duke of bridgewater fled to this country about the end of the last century to breathe the pure air of freedom married here and died leaving a son his own father dying about the same time the second son of the late duke seized the titles and estatesthe infant real duke was ignored i am the lineal descendant of that infanti am the rightful duke of bridgewater and here am i forlorn torn from my high estate hunted of men despised by the cold world ragged worn heartbroken and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft jim pitied him ever so much and so did i we tried to comfort him but he said it warnt much use he couldnt be much comforted said if we was a mind to acknowledge him that would do him more good than most anything else so we said we would if he would tell us how he said we ought to bow when we spoke to him and say your grace or my lord or your lordshipand he wouldnt mind it if we called him plain bridgewater which he said was a title anyway and not a name and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner and do any little thing for him he wanted done well that was all easy so we done it all through dinner jim stood around and waited on him and says will yo grace have some o dis or some o dat and so on and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him but the old man got pretty silent by and bydidnt have much to say and didnt look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke he seemed to have something on his mind so along in the afternoon he says looky here bilgewater he says im nation sorry for you but you aint the only person thats had troubles like that no no you aint you aint the only person thats ben snaked down wrongfully outn a high place alas no you aint the only person thats had a secret of his birth and by jings he begins to cry hold what do you mean bilgewater kin i trust you says the old man still sort of sobbing to the bitter death he took the old man by the hand and squeezed it and says that secret of your being speak bilgewater i am the late dauphin you bet you jim and me stared this time then the duke says you are what yes my friend it is too trueyour eyes is lookin at this very moment on the pore disappeared dauphin looy the seventeen son of looy the sixteen and marry antonette you at your age no you mean youre the late charlemagne you must be six or seven hundred years old at the very least trouble has done it bilgewater trouble has done it trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude yes gentlemen you see before you in blue jeans and misery the wanderin exiled trampledon and sufferin rightful king of france well he cried and took on so that me and jim didnt know hardly what to do we was so sorryand so glad and proud wed got him with us too so we set in like we done before with the duke and tried to comfort him but he said it warnt no use nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights and got down on one knee to speak to him and always called him your majesty and waited on him first at meals and didnt set down in his presence till he asked them so jim and me set to majestying him and doing this and that and tother for him and standing up till he told us we might set down this done him heaps of good and so he got cheerful and comfortable but the duke kind of soured on him and didnt look a bit satisfied with the way things was going still the king acted real friendly towards him and said the dukes greatgrandfather and all the other dukes of bilgewater was a good deal thought of by his father and was allowed to come to the palace considerable but the duke stayed huffy a good while till by and by the king says like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this hyer raft bilgewater and so whats the use o your bein sour it ll only make things oncomfortable it aint my fault i warnt born a duke it aint your fault you warnt born a kingso whats the use to worry make the best o things the way you find em says ithats my motto this aint no bad thing that weve struck hereplenty grub and an easy lifecome give us your hand duke and les all be friends the duke done it and jim and me was pretty glad to see it it took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft for what you want above all things on a raft is for everybody to be satisfied and feel right and kind towards the others it didnt take me long to make up my mind that these liars warnt no kings nor dukes at all but just lowdown humbugs and frauds but i never said nothing never let on kept it to myself its the best way then you dont have no quarrels and dont get into no trouble if they wanted us to call them kings and dukes i hadnt no objections long as it would keep peace in the family and it warnt no use to tell jim so i didnt tell him if i never learnt nothing else out of pap i learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way chapter xx they asked us considerable many questions wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for and laid by in the daytime instead of running was jim a runaway nigger says i goodness sakes would a runaway nigger run south no they allowed he wouldnt i had to account for things some way so i says my folks was living in pike county in missouri where i was born and they all died off but me and pa and my brother ike pa he lowed hed break up and go down and live with uncle ben whos got a little onehorse place on the river fortyfour mile below orleans pa was pretty poor and had some debts so when hed squared up there warnt nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger jim that warnt enough to take us fourteen hundred mile deck passage nor no other way well when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day he ketched this piece of a raft so we reckoned wed go down to orleans on it pas luck didnt hold out a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel jim and me come up all right but pa was drunk and ike was only four years old so they never come up no more well for the next day or two we had considerable trouble because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take jim away from me saying they believed he was a runaway nigger we dont run daytimes no more now nights they dont bother us the duke says leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to ill think the thing overill invent a plan thatll fix it well let it alone for today because of course we dont want to go by that town yonder in daylightit mightnt be healthy towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain the heat lightning was squirting around low down in the sky and the leaves was beginning to shiverit was going to be pretty ugly it was easy to see that so the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam to see what the beds was like my bed was a straw tick better than jims which was a cornshuck tick theres always cobs around about in a shuck tick and they poke into you and hurt and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves it makes such a rustling that you wake up well the duke allowed he would take my bed but the king allowed he wouldnt he says i should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a cornshuck bed warnt just fitten for me to sleep on your grace ll take the shuck bed yourself jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them so we was pretty glad when the duke says tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit i yield i submit tis my fate i am alone in the worldlet me suffer can bear it we got away as soon as it was good and dark the king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town we come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and bythat was the town you knowand slid by about a half a mile out all right when we was threequarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern and about ten oclock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night it was my watch below till twelve but i wouldnt a turned in anyway if id had a bed because a body dont see such a storm as that every day in the week not by a long sight my souls how the wind did scream along and every second or two thered come a glare that lit up the whitecaps for a half a mile around and youd see the islands looking dusty through the rain and the trees thrashing around in the wind then comes a hwhackbum bum bumbleumbleumbumbumbumbumand the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away and quitand then rip comes another flash and another sockdolager the waves most washed me off the raft sometimes but i hadnt any clothes on and didnt mind we didnt have no trouble about snags the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them i had the middle watch you know but i was pretty sleepy by that time so jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me he was always mighty good that way jim was i crawled into the wigwam but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warnt no show for me so i laid outsidei didnt mind the rain because it was warm and the waves warnt running so high now about two they come up again though and jim was going to call me but he changed his mind because he reckoned they warnt high enough yet to do any harm but he was mistaken about that for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard it most killed jim alaughing he was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was anyway i took the watch and jim he laid down and snored away and by and by the storm let up for good and all and the first cabinlight that showed i rousted him out and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day the king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast and him and the duke played sevenup a while five cents a game then they got tired of it and allowed they would lay out a campaign as they called it the duke went down into his carpetbag and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud one bill said the celebrated dr armand de montalban of paris would lecture on the science of phrenology at such and such a place on the blank day of blank at ten cents admission and furnish charts of character at twentyfive cents apiece the duke said that was him in another bill he was the worldrenowned shakespearian tragedian garrick the younger of drury lane london in other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things like finding water and gold with a diviningrod dissipating witch spells and so on by and by he says but the histrionic muse is the darling have you ever trod the boards royalty no says the king you shall then before youre three days older fallen grandeur says the duke the first good town we come to well hire a hall and do the sword fight in richard iii and the balcony scene in romeo and juliet how does that strike you im in up to the hub for anything that will pay bilgewater but you see i dont know nothing about playactin and haint ever seen much of it i was too small when pap used to have em at the palace do you reckon you can learn me easy all right im jist afreezn for something fresh anyway les commence right away so the duke he told him all about who romeo was and who juliet was and said he was used to being romeo so the king could be juliet but if juliets such a young gal duke my peeled head and my white whiskers is goin to look oncommon odd on her maybe no dont you worry these country jakes wont ever think of that besides you know youll be in costume and that makes all the difference in the world juliets in a balcony enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed and shes got on her nightgown and her ruffled nightcap here are the costumes for the parts he got out two or three curtaincalico suits which he said was meedyevil armor for richard iii and tother chap and a long white cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match the king was satisfied so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid spreadeagle way prancing around and acting at the same time to show how it had got to be done then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart there was a little onehorse town about three mile down the bend and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for jim so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing the king allowed he would go too and see if he couldnt strike something we was out of coffee so jim said i better go along with them in the canoe and get some when we got there there warnt nobody stirring streets empty and perfectly dead and still like sunday we found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back yard and he said everybody that warnt too young or too sick or too old was gone to campmeeting about two mile back in the woods the king got the directions and allowed hed go and work that campmeeting for all it was worth and i might go too the duke said what he was after was a printingoffice we found it a little bit of a concern up over a carpenter shopcarpenters and printers all gone to the meeting and no doors locked it was a dirty litteredup place and had ink marks and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them all over the walls the duke shed his coat and said he was all right now so me and the king lit out for the campmeeting we got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping for it was a most awful hot day there was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around the woods was full of teams and wagons hitched everywheres feeding out of the wagontroughs and stomping to keep off the flies there was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell and piles of watermelons and green corn and suchlike truck the preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds only they was bigger and held crowds of people the benches was made out of outside slabs of logs with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs they didnt have no backs the preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds the women had on sunbonnets and some had linseywoolsey frocks some gingham ones and a few of the young ones had on calico some of the young men was barefooted and some of the children didnt have on any clothes but just a towlinen shirt some of the old women was knitting and some of the young folks was courting on the sly the first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn he lined out two lines everybody sung it and it was kind of grand to hear it there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way then he lined out two more for them to singand so on the people woke up more and more and sung louder and louder and towards the end some begun to groan and some begun to shout then the preacher begun to preach and begun in earnest too and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other and then aleaning down over the front of it with his arms and his body going all the time and shouting his words out with all his might and every now and then he would hold up his bible and spread it open and kind of pass it around this way and that shouting its the brazen serpent in the wilderness look upon it and live and people would shout out gloryaamen and so he went on and the people groaning and crying and saying amen oh come to the mourners bench come black with sin amen come sick and sore amen come lame and halt and blind amen come pore and needy sunk in shame aamen come all thats worn and soiled and sufferingcome with a broken spirit come with a contrite heart come in your rags and sin and dirt the waters that cleanse is free the door of heaven stands openoh enter in and be at rest aamen glory glory hallelujah and so on you couldnt make out what the preacher said any more on account of the shouting and crying folks got up everywheres in the crowd and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners bench with the tears running down their faces and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw just crazy and wild well the first i knowed the king got agoing and you could hear him over everybody and next he went acharging up on to the platform and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people and he done it he told them he was a piratebeen a pirate for thirty years out in the indian oceanand his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight and he was home now to take out some fresh men and thanks to goodness hed been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent and he was glad of it it was the blessedest thing that ever happened to him because he was a changed man now and happy for the first time in his life and poor as he was he was going to start right off and work his way back to the indian ocean and put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path for he could do it better than anybody else being acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean and though it would take him a long time to get there without money he would get there anyway and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him dont you thank me dont you give me no credit it all belongs to them dear people in pokeville campmeeting natural brothers and benefactors of the race and that dear preacher there the truest friend a pirate ever had and then he busted into tears and so did everybody then somebody sings out take up a collection for him take up a collection well a half a dozen made a jump to do it but somebody sings out let him pass the hat around then everybody said it the preacher too so the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there and every little while the prettiest kind of girls with the tears running down their cheeks would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by and he always done it and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six timesand he was invited to stay a week and everybody wanted him to live in their houses and said theyd think it was an honor but he said as this was the last day of the campmeeting he couldnt do no good and besides he was in a sweat to get to the indian ocean right off and go to work on the pirates when we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eightyseven dollars and seventyfive cents and then he had fetched away a threegallon jug of whisky too that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods the king said take it all around it laid over any day hed ever put in in the missionarying line he said it warnt no use talking heathens dont amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a campmeeting with the duke was thinking hed been doing pretty well till the king come to show up but after that he didnt think so so much he had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printingofficehorse billsand took the money four dollars and he had got in ten dollars worth of advertisements for the paper which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advanceso they done it the price of the paper was two dollars a year but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it and was going to run it for cash he set up a little piece of poetry which he made himself out of his own headthree verseskind of sweet and saddishthe name of it was yes crush cold world this breaking heartand he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper and didnt charge nothing for it well he took in nine dollars and a half and said hed done a pretty square days work for it then he showed us another little job hed printed and hadnt charged for because it was for us it had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder and reward under it the reading was all about jim and just described him to a dot it said he run away from st jacques plantation forty mile below new orleans last winter and likely went north and whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses now says the duke after tonight we can run in the daytime if we want to whenever we see anybody coming we can tie jim hand and foot with a rope and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river and were too poor to travel on a steamboat so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward handcuffs and chains would look still better on jim but it wouldnt go well with the story of us being so poor too much like jewelry ropes are the correct thingwe must preserve the unities as we say on the boards we all said the duke was pretty smart and there couldnt be no trouble about running daytimes we judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the dukes work in the printing office was going to make in that little town then we could boom right along if we wanted to we laid low and kept still and never shoved out till nearly ten oclock then we slid by pretty wide away from the town and didnt hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it when jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning he says huck does you reckn we gwyne to run acrost any mo kings on dis trip no i says i reckon not well says he dats all right den i doan mine one er two kings but dats enough dis ones powerful drunk en de duke ain much better i found jim had been trying to get him to talk french so he could hear what it was like but he said he had been in this country so long and had so much trouble hed forgot it chapter xxi it was after sunup now but we went right on and didnt tie up the king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty but after theyd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal after breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches and let his legs dangle in the water so as to be comfortable and lit his pipe and went to getting his romeo and juliet by heart when he had got it pretty good him and the duke begun to practice it together the duke had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech and he made him sigh and put his hand on his heart and after a while he said he done it pretty well only he says you mustnt bellow out romeo that way like a bullyou must say it soft and sick and languishy soroomeo that is the idea for juliets a dear sweet mere child of a girl you know and she doesnt bray like a jackass well next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak laths and begun to practice the sword fightthe duke called himself richard iii and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see but by and by the king tripped and fell overboard and after that they took a rest and had a talk about all kinds of adventures theyd had in other times along the river after dinner the duke says well capet well want to make this a firstclass show you know so i guess well add a little more to it we want a little something to answer encores with anyway whats onkores bilgewater the duke told him and then says ill answer by doing the highland fling or the sailors hornpipe and youwell let me seeoh ive got ityou can do hamlets soliloquy hamlets which hamlets soliloquy you know the most celebrated thing in shakespeare ah its sublime sublime always fetches the house i havent got it in the bookive only got one volumebut i reckon i can piece it out from memory ill just walk up and down a minute and see if i can call it back from recollections vaults so he went to marching up and down thinking and frowning horrible every now and then then he would hoist up his eyebrows next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan next he would sigh and next hed let on to drop a tear it was beautiful to see him by and by he got it he told us to give attention then he strikes a most noble attitude with one leg shoved forwards and his arms stretched away up and his head tilted back looking up at the sky and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth and after that all through his speech he howled and spread around and swelled up his chest and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever i see before this is the speechi learned it easy enough while he was learning it to the king to be or not to be that is the bare bodkin that makes calamity of so long life for who would fardels bear till birnam wood do come to dunsinane but that the fear of something after death murders the innocent sleep great natures second course and makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune than fly to others that we know not of theres the respect must give us pause wake duncan with thy knocking i would thou couldst for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely the laws delay and the quietus which his pangs might take in the dead waste and middle of the night when churchyards yawn in customary suits of solemn black but that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns breathes forth contagion on the world and thus the native hue of resolution like the poor cat i the adage is sicklied oer with care and all the clouds that lowered oer our housetops with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action tis a consummation devoutly to be wished but soft you the fair ophelia ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws but get thee to a nunnerygo well the old man he liked that speech and he mighty soon got it so he could do it firstrate it seemed like he was just born for it and when he had his hand in and was excited it was perfectly lovely the way he would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off the first chance we got the duke he had some showbills printed and after that for two or three days as we floated along the raft was a most uncommon lively place for there warnt nothing but sword fighting and rehearsingas the duke called itgoing on all the time one morning when we was pretty well down the state of arkansaw we come in sight of a little onehorse town in a big bend so we tied up about threequarters of a mile above it in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees and all of us but jim took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our show we struck it mighty lucky there was going to be a circus there that afternoon and the country people was already beginning to come in in all kinds of old shackly wagons and on horses the circus would leave before night so our show would have a pretty good chance the duke he hired the courthouse and we went around and stuck up our bills they read like this shaksperean revival wonderful attraction for one night only the world renowned tragedians david garrick the younger of drury lane theatre london and edmund kean the elder of the royal haymarket theatre whitechapel pudding lane piccadilly london and the royal

the illustrious kean done by him consecutive nights in paris for one night only on account of imperative european engagements admission cents children and servants cents then we went loafing around town the stores and houses was most all old shackly dried up frame concerns that hadnt ever been painted they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed the houses had little gardens around them but they didnt seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpsonweeds and sunflowers and ash piles and old curledup boots and shoes and pieces of bottles and rags and playedout tinware the fences was made of different kinds of boards nailed on at different times and they leaned every which way and had gates that didnt generly have but one hingea leather one some of the fences had been whitewashed some time or another but the duke said it was in clumbus time like enough there was generly hogs in the garden and people driving them out all the stores was along one street they had white domestic awnings in front and the country people hitched their horses to the awningposts there was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings and loafers roosting on them all day long whittling them with their barlow knives and chawing tobacco and gaping and yawning and stretchinga mighty ornery lot they generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella but didnt wear no coats nor waistcoats they called one another bill and buck and hank and joe and andy and talked lazy and drawly and used considerable many cuss words there was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awningpost and he most always had his hands in his britchespockets except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch what a body was hearing amongst them all the time was gimme a chaw v tobacker hank caint i haint got but one chaw left ask bill maybe bill he gives him a chaw maybe he lies and says he aint got none some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world nor a chaw of tobacco of their own they get all their chawing by borrowing they say to a fellow i wisht youd len me a chaw jack i jist this minute give ben thompson the last chaw i hadwhich is a lie pretty much everytime it dont fool nobody but a stranger but jack aint no stranger so he says you give him a chaw did you so did your sisters cats grandmother you pay me back the chaws youve awready borryd offn me lafe buckner then ill loan you one or two ton of it and wont charge you no back intrust nuther well i did pay you back some of it wunst yes you didbout six chaws you borryd store tobacker and paid back niggerhead store tobacco is flat black plug but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted when they borrow a chaw they dont generly cut it off with a knife but set the plug in between their teeth and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when its handed back and says sarcastic here gimme the chaw and you take the plug all the streets and lanes was just mud they warnt nothing else but mud mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places and two or three inches deep in all the places the hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres youd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way where folks had to walk around her and shed stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her and look as happy as if she was on salary and pretty soon youd hear a loafer sing out hi so boy sick him tige and away the sow would go squealing most horrible with a dog or two swinging to each ear and three or four dozen more acoming and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise then theyd settle back again till there was a dog fight there couldnt anything wake them up all over and make them happy all over like a dog fightunless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death on the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank and they was bowed and bent and about ready to tumble in the people had moved out of them the bank was caved away under one corner of some others and that corner was hanging over people lived in them yet but it was dangersome because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer such a town as that has to be always moving back and back and back because the rivers always gnawing at it the nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets and more coming all the time families fetched their dinners with them from the country and eat them in the wagons there was considerable whisky drinking going on and i seen three fights by and by somebody sings out here comes old boggsin from the country for his little old monthly drunk here he comes boys all the loafers looked glad i reckoned they was used to having fun out of boggs one of them says wonder who hes agwyne to chaw up this time if hed achawed up all the men hes ben agwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year hed have considerable ruputation now another one says i wisht old boggs d threaten me cuz then id know i warnt gwyne to die for a thousan year boggs comes atearing along on his horse whooping and yelling like an injun and singing out cler the track thar im on the wawpath and the price uv coffins is agwyne to raise he was drunk and weaving about in his saddle he was over fifty year old and had a very red face everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him and he sassed back and said hed attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns but he couldnt wait now because hed come to town to kill old colonel sherburn and his motto was meat first and spoon vittles to top off on he see me and rode up and says whard you come fm boy you prepared to die then he rode on i was scared but a man says he dont mean nothing hes always acarryin on like that when hes drunk hes the best naturedest old fool in arkansawnever hurt nobody drunk nor sober boggs rode up before the biggest store in town and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells come out here sherburn come out and meet the man youve swindled youre the houn im after and im agwyne to have you too and so he went on calling sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on by and by a proudlooking man about fiftyfiveand he was a heap the best dressed man in that town toosteps out of the store and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come he says to boggs mighty cam and slowhe says im tired of this but ill endure it till one oclock till one oclock mindno longer if you open your mouth against me only once after that time you cant travel so far but i will find you then he turns and goes in the crowd looked mighty sober nobody stirred and there warnt no more laughing boggs rode off blackguarding sherburn as loud as he could yell all down the street and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store still keeping it up some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up but he wouldnt they told him it would be one oclock in about fifteen minutes and so he must go homehe must go right away but it didnt do no good he cussed away with all his might and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it and pretty soon away he went araging down the street again with his gray hair aflying everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober but it warnt no useup the street he would tear again and give sherburn another cussing by and by somebody says go for his daughterquick go for his daughter sometimes hell listen to her if anybody can persuade him she can so somebody started on a run i walked down street a ways and stopped in about five or ten minutes here comes boggs again but not on his horse he was areeling across the street towards me bareheaded with a friend on both sides of him aholt of his arms and hurrying him along he was quiet and looked uneasy and he warnt hanging back any but was doing some of the hurrying himself somebody sings out boggs i looked over there to see who said it and it was that colonel sherburn he was standing perfectly still in the street and had a pistol raised in his right handnot aiming it but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky the same second i see a young girl coming on the run and two men with her boggs and the men turned round to see who called him and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side and the pistolbarrel come down slow and steady to a levelboth barrels cocked boggs throws up both of his hands and says o lord dont shoot bang goes the first shot and he staggers back clawing at the airbang goes the second one and he tumbles backwards on to the ground heavy and solid with his arms spread out that young girl screamed out and comes rushing and down she throws herself on her father crying and saying oh hes killed him hes killed him the crowd closed up around them and shouldered and jammed one another with their necks stretched trying to see and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting back back give him air give him air colonel sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground and turned around on his heels and walked off they took boggs to a little drug store the crowd pressing around just the same and the whole town following and i rushed and got a good place at the window where i was close to him and could see in they laid him on the floor and put one large bible under his head and opened another one and spread it on his breast but they tore open his shirt first and i seen where one of the bullets went in he made about a dozen long gasps his breast lifting the bible up when he drawed in his breath and letting it down again when he breathed it outand after that he laid still he was dead then they pulled his daughter away from him screaming and crying and took her off she was about sixteen and very sweet and gentle looking but awful pale and scared well pretty soon the whole town was there squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look but people that had the places wouldnt give them up and folks behind them was saying all the time say now youve looked enough you fellows taint right and taint fair for you to stay thar all the time and never give nobody a chance other folks has their rights as well as you there was considerable jawing back so i slid out thinking maybe there was going to be trouble the streets was full and everybody was excited everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows stretching their necks and listening one long lanky man with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head and a crookedhandled cane marked out the places on the ground where boggs stood and where sherburn stood and the people following him around from one place to tother and watching everything he done and bobbing their heads to show they understood and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane and then he stood up straight and stiff where sherburn had stood frowning and having his hatbrim down over his eyes and sung out boggs and then fetched his cane down slow to a level and says bang staggered backwards says bang again and fell down flat on his back the people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect said it was just exactly the way it all happened then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him well by and by somebody said sherburn ought to be lynched in about a minute everybody was saying it so away they went mad and yelling and snatching down every clothesline they come to to do the hanging with chapter xxii they swarmed up towards sherburns house awhooping and raging like injuns and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush and it was awful to see children was heeling it ahead of the mob screaming and trying to get out of the way and every window along the road was full of womens heads and there was nigger boys in every tree and bucks and wenches looking over every fence and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on scared most to death they swarmed up in front of sherburns palings as thick as they could jam together and you couldnt hear yourself think for the noise it was a little twentyfoot yard some sung out tear down the fence tear down the fence then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing and down she goes and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave just then sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch with a doublebarrel gun in his hand and takes his stand perfectly cam and deliberate not saying a word the racket stopped and the wave sucked back sherburn never said a wordjust stood there looking down the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to outgaze him but they couldnt they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky then pretty soon sherburn sort of laughed not the pleasant kind but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread thats got sand in it then he says slow and scornful the idea of you lynching anybody its amusing the idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man because youre brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless castout women that come along here did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man why a mans safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kindas long as its daytime and youre not behind him do i know you i know you clear through was born and raised in the south and ive lived in the north so i know the average all around the average mans a coward in the north he lets anybody walk over him that wants to and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it in the south one man all by himself has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime and robbed the lot your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other peoplewhereas youre just as brave and no braver why dont your juries hang murderers because theyre afraid the mans friends will shoot them in the back in the darkand its just what they would do so they always acquit and then a man goes in the night with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal your mistake is that you didnt bring a man with you thats one mistake and the other is that you didnt come in the dark and fetch your masks you brought part of a manbuck harkness thereand if you hadnt had him to start you youd a taken it out in blowing you didnt want to come the average man dont like trouble and danger you dont like trouble and danger but if only half a manlike buck harkness thereshouts lynch him lynch him youre afraid to back downafraid youll be found out to be what you arecowardsand so you raise a yell and hang yourselves on to that halfamans coattail and come raging up here swearing what big things youre going to do the pitifulest thing out is a mob thats what an army isa mob they dont fight with courage thats born in them but with courage thats borrowed from their mass and from their officers but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole if any real lynchings going to be done it will be done in the dark southern fashion and when they come theyll bring their masks and fetch a man along now leaveand take your halfaman with youtossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck harkness he heeled it after them looking tolerable cheap i could a stayed if i wanted to but i didnt want to i went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by and then dived in under the tent i had my twentydollar gold piece and some other money but i reckoned i better save it because there aint no telling how soon you are going to need it away from home and amongst strangers that way you cant be too careful i aint opposed to spending money on circuses when there aint no other way but there aint no use in wasting it on them it was a real bully circus it was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in two and two a gentleman and lady side by side the men just in their drawers and undershirts and no shoes nor stirrups and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable there must a been twenty of themand every lady with a lovely complexion and perfectly beautiful and looking just like a gang of real sureenough queens and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars and just littered with diamonds it was a powerful fine sight i never see anything so lovely and then one by one they got up and stood and went aweaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight with their heads bobbing and skimming along away up there under the tentroof and every ladys roseleafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips and she looking like the most loveliest parasol and then faster and faster they went all of them dancing first one foot out in the air and then the other the horses leaning more and more and the ringmaster going round and round the centerpole cracking his whip and shouting hihi and the clown cracking jokes behind him and by and by all hands dropped the reins and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves and so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring and made the sweetest bow i ever see and then scampered out and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild well all through the circus they done the most astonishing things and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people the ringmaster couldnt ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said and how he ever could think of so many of them and so sudden and so pat was what i couldnt noway understand why i couldnt a thought of them in a year and by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ringsaid he wanted to ride said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was they argued and tried to keep him out but he wouldnt listen and the whole show come to a standstill then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him and that made him mad and he begun to rip and tear so that stirred up the people and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring saying knock him down throw him out and one or two women begun to scream so then the ringmaster he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldnt be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldnt make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse so everybody laughed and said all right and the man got on the minute he was on the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him and the drunk man hanging on to his neck and his heels flying in the air every jump and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down and at last sure enough all the circus men could do the horse broke loose and away he went like the very nation round and round the ring with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side and then tother one on tother side and the people just crazy it warnt funny to me though i was all of a tremble to see his danger but pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle areeling this way and that and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood and the horse agoing like a house afire too he just stood up there asailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warnt ever drunk in his lifeand then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them he shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits and then there he was slim and handsome and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly humand finally skipped off and made his bow and danced off to the dressingroom and everybody just ahowling with pleasure and astonishment then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled and he was the sickest ringmaster you ever see i reckon why it was one of his own men he had got up that joke all out of his own head and never let on to nobody well i felt sheepish enough to be took in so but i wouldnt a been in that ringmasters place not for a thousand dollars i dont know there may be bullier circuses than what that one was but i never struck them yet anyways it was plenty good enough for me and wherever i run across it it can have all of my custom every time well that night we had our show but there warnt only about twelve people therejust enough to pay expenses and they laughed all the time and that made the duke mad and everybody left anyway before the show was over but one boy which was asleep so the duke said these arkansaw lunkheads couldnt come up to shakespeare what they wanted was low comedyand maybe something ruther worse than low comedy he reckoned he said he could size their style so next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint and drawed off some handbills and stuck them up all over the village the bills said at the court house for nights only the worldrenowned tragedians david garrick the younger and edmund kean the elder of the london and continental theatres in their thrilling tragedy of the kings cameleopard or the royal nonesuch admission cents then at the bottom was the biggest line of all which said ladies and children not admitted there says he if that line dont fetch them i dont know arkansaw chapter xxiii well all day him and the king was hard at it rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights and that night the house was jam full of men in no time when the place couldnt hold no more the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech and praised up this tragedy and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was and so he went on abragging about the tragedy and about edmund kean the elder which was to play the main principal part in it and at last when hed got everybodys expectations up high enough he rolled up the curtain and the next minute the king come aprancing out on all fours naked and he was painted all over ringstreakedand striped all sorts of colors as splendid as a rainbow andbut never mind the rest of his outfit it was just wild but it was awful funny the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and hawhawed till he come back and done it over again and after that they made him do it another time well it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut then the duke he lets the curtain down and bows to the people and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more on accounts of pressing london engagements where the seats is all sold already for it in drury lane and then he makes them another bow and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it twenty people sings out what is it over is that all the duke says yes then there was a fine time everybody sings out sold and rose up mad and was agoing for that stage and them tragedians but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts hold on just a word gentlemen they stopped to listen we are soldmighty badly sold but we dont want to be the laughing stock of this whole town i reckon and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live no what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this show up and sell the rest of the town then well all be in the same boat aint that sensible you bet it isthe jedge is right everybody sings out all right thennot a word about any sell go along home and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy next day you couldnt hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was house was jammed again that night and we sold this crowd the same way when me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper and by and by about midnight they made jim and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town the third night the house was crammed againand they warnt newcomers this time but people that was at the show the other two nights i stood by the duke at the door and i see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging or something muffled up under his coatand i see it warnt no perfumery neither not by a long sight i smelt sickly eggs by the barrel and rotten cabbages and such things and if i know the signs of a dead cat being around and i bet i do there was sixtyfour of them went in i shoved in there for a minute but it was too various for me i couldnt stand it well when the place couldnt hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute and then he started around for the stage door i after him but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says walk fast now till you get away from the houses and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you i done it and he done the same we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream all dark and still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word i reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience but nothing of the sort pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam and says well howd the old thing pan out this time duke he hadnt been uptown at all we never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village then we lit up and had a supper and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way theyd served them people the duke says greenhorns flatheads i knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in and i knew theyd lay for us the third night and consider it was their turn now well it is their turn and id give something to know how much theyd take for it i would just like to know how theyre putting in their opportunity they can turn it into a picnic if they want tothey brought plenty provisions them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixtyfive dollars in that three nights i never see money hauled in by the wagonload like that before by and by when they was asleep and snoring jim says dont it sprise you de way dem kings carries on huck no i says it dont why dont it huck well it dont because its in the breed i reckon theyre all alike but huck dese kings o ourn is reglar rapscallions dats jist what dey is deys reglar rapscallions well thats what im asaying all kings is mostly rapscallions as fur as i can make out is dat so you read about them onceyoull see look at henry the eight this n s a sundayschool superintendent to him and look at charles second and louis fourteen and louis fifteen and james second and edward second and richard third and forty more besides all them saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise cain my you ought to seen old henry the eight when he was in bloom he was a blossom he used to marry a new wife every day and chop off her head next morning and he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs fetch up nell gwynn he says they fetch her up next morning chop off her head and they chop it off fetch up jane shore he says and up she comes next morning chop off her headand they chop it off ring up fair rosamun fair rosamun answers the bell next morning chop off her head and he made every one of them tell him a tale every night and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way and then he put them all in a book and called it domesday bookwhich was a good name and stated the case you dont know kings jim but i know them and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest ive struck in history well henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country how does he go at it give noticegive the country a show no all of a sudden he heaves all the tea in boston harbor overboard and whacks out a declaration of independence and dares them to come on that was his stylehe never give anybody a chance he had suspicions of his father the duke of wellington well what did he do ask him to show up nodrownded him in a butt of mamsey like a cat spose people left money laying around where he waswhat did he do he collared it spose he contracted to do a thing and you paid him and didnt set down there and see that he done itwhat did he do he always done the other thing spose he opened his mouthwhat then if he didnt shut it up powerful quick hed lose a lie every time thats the kind of a bug henry was and if wed a had him along stead of our kings hed a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done i dont say that ourn is lambs because they aint when you come right down to the cold facts but they aint nothing to that old ram anyway all i say is kings is kings and you got to make allowances take them all around theyre a mighty ornery lot its the way theyre raised but dis one do smell so like de nation huck well they all do jim we cant help the way a king smells history dont tell no way now de duke hes a tolerble likely man in some ways yes a dukes different but not very different this ones a middling hard lot for a duke when hes drunk there aint no nearsighted man could tell him from a king well anyways i doan hanker for no mo un um huck dese is all i kin stan its the way i feel too jim but weve got them on our hands and we got to remember what they are and make allowances sometimes i wish we could hear of a country thats out of kings what was the use to tell jim these warnt real kings and dukes it wouldnt a done no good and besides it was just as i said you couldnt tell them from the real kind i went to sleep and jim didnt call me when it was my turn he often done that when i waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees moaning and mourning to himself i didnt take notice nor let on i knowed what it was about he was thinking about his wife and his children away up yonder and he was low and homesick because he hadnt ever been away from home before in his life and i do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for theirn it dont seem natural but i reckon its so he was often moaning and mourning that way nights when he judged i was asleep and saying po little lizabeth po little johnny its mighty hard i spec i aint ever gwyne to see you no mo no mo he was a mighty good nigger jim was but this time i somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones and by and by he says what makes me feel so bad dis time uz bekase i hear sumpn over yonder on de bank like a whack er a slam while ago en it mine me er de

next day towards night we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle where there was a village on each side of the river and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns jim he spoke to the duke and said he hoped it wouldnt take but a few hours because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope you see when we left him all alone we had to tie him because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldnt look much like he was a runaway nigger you know so the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay roped all day and hed cipher out some way to get around it he was uncommon bright the duke was and he soon struck it he dressed jim up in king lears outfitit was a long curtaincalico gown and a white horsehair wig and whiskers and then he took his theater paint and painted jims face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead dull solid blue like a man thats been drownded nine days blamed if he warnt the horriblest looking outrage i ever see then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so sick arabbut harmless when not out of his head and he nailed that shingle to a lath and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam jim was satisfied he said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day and trembling all over every time there was a sound the duke told him to make himself free and easy and if anybody ever come meddling around he must hop out of the wigwam and carry on a little and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldnt wait for him to howl why he didnt only look like he was dead he looked considerable more than that these rapscallions wanted to try the nonesuch again because there was so much money in it but they judged it wouldnt be safe because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time they couldnt hit no project that suited exactly so at last the duke said he reckoned hed lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldnt put up something on the arkansaw village and the king he allowed he would drop over to tother village without any plan but just trust in providence to lead him the profitable waymeaning the devil i reckon we had all bought store clothes where we stopped last and now the king put hisn on and he told me to put mine on i done it of course the kings duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy i never knowed how clothes could change a body before why before he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when hed take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good and pious that youd say he had walked right out of the ark and maybe was old leviticus himself jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my paddle ready there was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point about three mile above the townbeen there a couple of hours taking on freight says the king seein how im dressed i reckon maybe i better arrive down from st louis or cincinnati or some other big place go for the steamboat huckleberry well come down to the village on her i didnt have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride i fetched the shore a half a mile above the village and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water pretty soon we come to a nice innocentlooking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face for it was powerful warm weather and he had a couple of big carpetbags by him run her nose in shore says the king i done it wher you bound for young man for the steamboat going to orleans git aboard says the king hold on a minute my servant ll hep you with them bags jump out and hep the gentleman adolphusmeaning me i see i done so and then we all three started on again the young chap was mighty thankful said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather he asked the king where he was going and the king told him hed come down the river and landed at the other village this morning and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there the young fellow says when i first see you i says to myself its mr wilks sure and he come mighty near getting here in time but then i says again no i reckon it aint him or else he wouldnt be paddling up the river you aint him are you no my names blodgettelexander blodgettreverend elexander blodgett i spose i must say as im one o the lords poor servants but still im jist as able to be sorry for mr wilks for not arriving in time all the same if hes missed anything by itwhich i hope he hasnt well he dont miss any property by it because hell get that all right but hes missed seeing his brother peter diewhich he maynt mind nobody can tell as to thatbut his brother would a give anything in this world to see him before he died never talked about nothing else all these three weeks hadnt seen him since they was boys togetherand hadnt ever seen his brother william at allthats the deef and dumb onewilliam aint more than thirty or thirtyfive peter and george were the only ones that come out here george was the married brother him and his wife both died last year harvey and williams the only ones thats left now and as i was saying they havent got here in time did anybody send em word oh yes a month or two ago when peter was first took because peter said then that he sorter felt like he warnt going to get well this time you see he was pretty old and georges gyirls was too young to be much company for him except mary jane the redheaded one and so he was kinder lonesome after george and his wife died and didnt seem to care much to live he most desperately wanted to see harveyand william too for that matterbecause he was one of them kind that cant bear to make a will he left a letter behind for harvey and said hed told in it where his money was hid and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so georges gyirls would be all rightfor george didnt leave nothing and that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to why do you reckon harvey dont come wher does he live oh he lives in englandsheffieldpreaches therehasnt ever been in this country he hasnt had any too much timeand besides he mightnt a got the letter at all you know too bad too bad he couldnt a lived to see his brothers poor soul you going to orleans you say yes but that aint only a part of it im going in a ship next wednesday for ryo janeero where my uncle lives its a pretty long journey but itll be lovely wisht i was agoing is mary jane the oldest how old is the others mary janes nineteen susans fifteen and joannas about fourteen thats the one that gives herself to good works and has a harelip poor things to be left alone in the cold world so well they could be worse off old peter had friends and they aint going to let them come to no harm theres hobson the babtis preacher and deacon lot hovey and ben rucker and abner shackleford and levi bell the lawyer and dr robinson and their wives and the widow bartley andwell theres a lot of them but these are the ones that peter was thickest with and used to write about sometimes when he wrote home so harvey ll know where to look for friends when he gets here well the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow blamed if he didnt inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the wilkses and about peters businesswhich was a tanner and about georgeswhich was a carpenter and about harveyswhich was a dissentering minister and so on and so on then he says what did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for because shes a big orleans boat and i was afeard she mightnt stop there when theyre deep they wont stop for a hail a cincinnati boat will but this is a st louis one was peter wilks well off oh yes pretty well off he had houses and land and its reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up somers when did you say he died i didnt say but it was last night funeral tomorrow likely yes bout the middle of the day well its all terrible sad but weve all got to go one time or another so what we want to do is to be prepared then were all right yes sir its the best way ma used to always say that when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got off the king never said nothing about going aboard so i lost my ride after all when the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place and then he got ashore and says now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpetbags and if hes gone over to tother side go over there and git him and tell him to git himself up regardless shove along now i see what he was up to but i never said nothing of course when i got back with the duke we hid the canoe and then they set down on a log and the king told him everything just like the young fellow had said it every last word of it and all the time he was adoing it he tried to talk like an englishman and he done it pretty well too for a slouch i cant imitate him and so i aint agoing to try to but he really done it pretty good then he says how are you on the deef and dumb bilgewater the duke said leave him alone for that said he had played a deef and dumb person on the histronic boards so then they waited for a steamboat about the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along but they didnt come from high enough up the river but at last there was a big one and they hailed her she sent out her yawl and we went aboard and she was from cincinnati and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad and gave us a cussing and said they wouldnt land us but the king was cam he says if gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl a steamboat kin afford to carry em cant it so they softened down and said it was all right and when we got to the village they yawled us ashore about two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl acoming and when the king says kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher mr peter wilks lives they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say what d i tell you then one of them says kind of soft and gentle im sorry sir but the best we can do is to tell you where he did live yesterday evening sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash and fell up against the man and put his chin on his shoulder and cried down his back and says alas alas our poor brothergone and we never got to see him oh its too too hard then he turns around blubbering and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands and blamed if he didnt drop a carpetbag and bust out acrying if they warnt the beatenest lot them two frauds that ever i struck well the men gathered around and sympathized with them and said all sorts of kind things to them and carried their carpetbags up the hill for them and let them lean on them and cry and told the king all about his brothers last moments and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke and both of them took on about that dead tanner like theyd lost the twelve disciples well if ever i struck anything like it im a nigger it was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race chapter xxv the news was all over town in two minutes and you could see the people tearing down on the run from every which way some of them putting on their coats as they come pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march the windows and dooryards was full and every minute somebody would say over a fence is it them and somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say you bet it is when we got to the house the street in front of it was packed and the three girls was standing in the door mary jane was redheaded but that dont make no difference she was most awful beautiful and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory she was so glad her uncles was come the king he spread his arms and mary jane she jumped for them and the harelip jumped for the duke and there they had it everybody most leastways women cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good times then the king he hunched the duke privatei see him do itand then he looked around and see the coffin over in the corner on two chairs so then him and the duke with a hand across each others shoulder and tother hand to their eyes walked slow and solemn over there everybody dropping back to give them room and all the talk and noise stopping people saying sh and all the men taking their hats off and drooping their heads so you could a heard a pin fall and when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin and took one sight and then they bust out acrying so you could a heard them to orleans most and then they put their arms around each others necks and hung their chins over each others shoulders and then for three minutes or maybe four i never see two men leak the way they done and mind you everybody was doing the same and the place was that damp i never see anything like it then one of them got on one side of the coffin and tother on tother side and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin and let on to pray all to themselves well when it come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loudthe poor girls too and every woman nearly went up to the girls without saying a word and kissed them solemn on the forehead and then put their hand on their head and looked up towards the sky with the tears running down and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing and give the next woman a show i never see anything so disgusting well by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little and works himself up and slobbers out a speech all full of tears and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the diseased and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile but its a trial thats sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his brothers heart because out of their mouths they cant words being too weak and cold and all that kind of rot and slush till it was just sickening and then he blubbers out a pious goodygoody amen and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust and the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer and everybody joined in with all their might and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out music is a good thing and after all that soulbutter and hogwash i never see it freshen up things so and sound so honest and bully then the king begins to work his jaw again and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening and help set up with the ashes of the diseased and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who he would name for they was names that was very dear to him and mentioned often in his letters and so he will name the same to wit as follows vizzrev mr hobson and deacon lot hovey and mr ben rucker and abner shackleford and levi bell and dr robinson and their wives and the widow bartley rev hobson and dr robinson was down to the end of the town ahunting togetherthat is i mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to tother world and the preacher was pinting him right lawyer bell was away up to louisville on business but the rest was on hand and so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him and then they shook hands with the duke and didnt say nothing but just kept asmiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said googoogoogoogoo all the time like a baby that cant talk so the king he blattered along and managed to inquire about pretty much everybody and dog in town by his name and mentioned all sorts of little things that happened one time or another in the town or to georges family or to peter and he always let on that peter wrote him the things but that was a lie he got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat then mary jane she fetched the letter her father left behind and the king he read it out loud and cried over it it give the dwellinghouse and three thousand dollars gold to the girls and it give the tanyard which was doing a good business along with some other houses and land worth about seven thousand and three thousand dollars in gold to harvey and william and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar so these two frauds said theyd go and fetch it up and have everything square and aboveboard and told me to come with a candle we shut the cellar door behind us and when they found the bag they spilt it out on the floor and it was a lovely sight all them yallerboys my the way the kings eyes did shine he slaps the duke on the shoulder and says oh this aint bully nor nothn oh no i reckon not why biljy it beats the nonesuch dont it the duke allowed it did they pawed the yallerboys and sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor and the king says it aint no use talkin bein brothers to a rich dead man and representatives of furrin heirs thats got left is the line for you and me bilge thish yer comes of trustn to providence its the best way in the long run ive tried em all and ther aint no better way most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile and took it on trust but no they must count it so they counts it and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short says the king dern him i wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen dollars they worried over that awhile and ransacked all around for it then the duke says well he was a pretty sick man and likely he made a mistakei reckon thats the way of it the best ways to let it go and keep still about it we can spare it oh shucks yes we can spare it i dont kyer nothn bout thatits the count im thinkin about we want to be awful square and open and aboveboard here you know we want to lug this hyer money up stairs and count it before everybodythen ther aint nothn suspicious but when the dead man says thers six thousn dollars you know we dont want to hold on says the duke les make up the deffisit and he begun to haul out yallerboys out of his pocket its a most amazn good idea dukeyou have got a rattlin clever head on you says the king blest if the old nonesuch aint a heppin us out agin and he begun to haul out yallerjackets and stack them up it most busted them but they made up the six thousand clean and clear say says the duke i got another idea les go up stairs and count this money and then take and give it to the girls good land duke lemme hug you its the most dazzling idea at ever a man struck you have certnly got the most astonishin head i ever see oh this is the boss dodge ther aint no mistake bout it let em fetch along their suspicions now if they want tothis ll lay em out when we got upstairs everybody gethered around the table and the king he counted it and stacked it up three hundred dollars in a piletwenty elegant little piles everybody looked hungry at it and licked their chops then they raked it into the bag again and i see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech he says friends all my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them thats left behind in the vale of sorrers he has done generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered and thats left fatherless and motherless yes and we that knowed him knows that he would a done more generous by em if he hadnt ben afeard o woundin his dear william and me now wouldnt he ther aint no question bout it in my mind well then what kind o brothers would it be that d stand in his way at sech a time and what kind o uncles would it be that d robyes robsech poor sweet lambs as these at he loved so at sech a time if i know williamand i think i dohewell ill jest ask him he turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his hands and the duke he looks at him stupid and leatherheaded a while then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning and jumps for the king googooing with all his might for joy and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up then the king says i knowed it i reckon that ll convince anybody the way he feels about it here mary jane susan joanner take the moneytake it all its the gift of him that lays yonder cold but joyful mary jane she went for him susan and the harelip went for the duke and then such another hugging and kissing i never see yet and everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes and most shook the hands off of them frauds saying all the time you dear good soulshow lovelyhow could you well then pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again and how good he was and what a loss he was and all that and before long a big ironjawed man worked himself in there from outside and stood alistening and looking and not saying anything and nobody saying anything to him either because the king was talking and they was all busy listening the king was sayingin the middle of something hed started in on they bein partickler friends o the diseased thats why theyre invited here this evenin but tomorrow we want all to comeeverybody for he respected everybody he liked everybody and so its fitten that his funeral orgies shd be public and so he went amooning on and on liking to hear himself talk and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again till the duke he couldnt stand it no more so he writes on a little scrap of paper obsequies you old fool and folds it up and goes to googooing and reaching it over peoples heads to him the king he reads it and puts it in his pocket and says poor william afflicted as he is his hearts aluz right asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeralwants me to make em all welcome but he neednt a worriedit was jest what i was at then he weaves along again perfectly cam and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then just like he done before and when he done it the third time he says i say orgies not because its the common term because it aint obsequies bein the common termbut because orgies is the right term obsequies aint used in england no more nowits gone out we say orgies now in england orgies is better because it means the thing youre after more exact its a word thats made up outn the greek orgo outside open abroad and the hebrew jeesum to plant cover up hence inter so you see funeral orgies is an open er public funeral he was the worst i ever struck well the ironjawed man he laughed right in his face everybody was shocked everybody says why doctor and abner shackleford says why robinson haint you heard the news this is harvey wilks the king he smiled eager and shoved out his flapper and says is it my poor brothers dear good friend and physician i keep your hands off of me says the doctor you talk like an englishman dont you its the worst imitation i ever heard you peter wilkss brother youre a fraud thats what you are well how they all took on they crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him down and tried to explain to him and tell him how harvey d showed in forty ways that he was harvey and knowed everybody by name and the names of the very dogs and begged and begged him not to hurt harveys feelings and the poor girls feelings and all that but it warnt no use he stormed right along and said any man that pretended to be an englishman and couldnt imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar the poor girls was hanging to the king and crying and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on them he says i was your fathers friend and im your friend and i warn you as a friend and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm and trouble to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with him the ignorant tramp with his idiotic greek and hebrew as he calls it he is the thinnest kind of an impostorhas come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres and you take them for proofs and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here who ought to know better mary jane wilks you know me for your friend and for your unselfish friend too now listen to me turn this pitiful rascal outi beg you to do it will you mary jane straightened herself up and my but she was handsome she says here is my answer she hove up the bag of money and put it in the kings hands and says take this six thousand dollars and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to and dont give us no receipt for it then she put her arm around the king on one side and susan and the harelip done the same on the other everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud the doctor says all right i wash my hands of the matter but i warn you all that a time s coming when youre going to feel sick whenever you think of this day and away he went all right doctor says the king kinder mocking him well try and get em to send for you which made them all laugh and they said it was a prime good hit chapter xxvi well when they was all gone the king he asks mary jane how they was off for spare rooms and she said she had one spare room which would do for uncle william and shed give her own room to uncle harvey which was a little bigger and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot and up garret was a little cubby with a pallet in it the king said the cubby would do for his valleymeaning me so mary jane took us up and she showed them their rooms which was plain but nice she said shed have her frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her room if they was in uncle harveys way but he said they warnt the frocks was hung along the wall and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor there was an old hair trunk in one corner and a guitarbox in another and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around like girls brisken up a room with the king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings and so dont disturb them the dukes room was pretty small but plenty good enough and so was my cubby that night they had a big supper and all them men and women was there and i stood behind the king and the dukes chairs and waited on them and the niggers waited on the rest mary jane she set at the head of the table with susan alongside of her and said how bad the biscuits was and how mean the preserves was and how ornery and tough

hed be in the pulpit rot him i forgot he was a preacher i see i was up a stump again so i played another chicken bone and got another think then i says blame it do you suppose there aint but one preacher to a church why what do they want with more whatto preach before a king i never did see such a girl as you they dont have no less than seventeen seventeen my land why i wouldnt set out such a string as that not if i never got to glory it must take em a week shucks they dont all of em preach the same dayonly one of em well then what does the rest of em do oh nothing much loll around pass the plateand one thing or another but mainly they dont do nothing well then what are they for why theyre for style dont you know nothing well i dont want to know no such foolishness as that how is servants treated in england do they treat em better n we treat our niggers no a servant aint nobody there they treat them worse than dogs dont they give em holidays the way we do christmas and new years week and fourth of july oh just listen a body could tell you haint ever been to england by that why harelwhy joanna they never see a holiday from years end to years end never go to the circus nor theater nor nigger shows nor nowheres nor church nor church but you always went to church well i was gone up again i forgot i was the old mans servant but next minute i whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and had to go to church whether he wanted to or not and set with the family on account of its being the law but i didnt do it pretty good and when i got done i see she warnt satisfied she says honest injun now haint you been telling me a lot of lies honest injun says i none of it at all none of it at all not a lie in it says i lay your hand on this book and say it i see it warnt nothing but a dictionary so i laid my hand on it and said it so then she looked a little better satisfied and says well then ill believe some of it but i hope to gracious if ill believe the rest what is it you wont believe joe says mary jane stepping in with susan behind her it aint right nor kind for you to talk so to him and him a stranger and so far from his people how would you like to be treated so thats always your way maimalways sailing in to help somebody before theyre hurt i haint done nothing to him hes told some stretchers i reckon and i said i wouldnt swallow it all and thats every bit and grain i did say i reckon he can stand a little thing like that cant he i dont care whether twas little or whether twas big hes here in our house and a stranger and it wasnt good of you to say it if you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed and so you oughtnt to say a thing to another person that will make them feel ashamed why maim he said it dont make no difference what he saidthat aint the thing the thing is for you to treat him kind and not be saying things to make him remember he aint in his own country and amongst his own folks i says to myself this is a girl that im letting that old reptle rob her of her money then susan she waltzed in and if youll believe me she did give harelip hark from the tomb says i to myself and this is another one that im letting him rob her of her money then mary jane she took another inning and went in sweet and lovely againwhich was her way but when she got done there warnt hardly anything left o poor harelip so she hollered all right then says the other girls you just ask his pardon she done it too and she done it beautiful she done it so beautiful it was good to hear and i wished i could tell her a thousand lies so she could do it again i says to myself this is another one that im letting him rob her of her money and when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know i was amongst friends i felt so ornery and low down and mean that i says to myself my minds made up ill hive that money for them or bust so then i lit outfor bed i said meaning some time or another when i got by myself i went to thinking the thing over i says to myself shall i go to that doctor private and blow on these frauds nothat wont do he might tell who told him then the king and the duke would make it warm for me shall i go private and tell mary jane noi dasnt do it her face would give them a hint sure theyve got the money and theyd slide right out and get away with it if she was to fetch in help id get mixed up in the business before it was done with i judge no there aint no good way but one i got to steal that money somehow and i got to steal it some way that they wont suspicion that i done it theyve got a good thing here and they aint agoing to leave till theyve played this family and this town for all theyre worth so ill find a chance time enough ill steal it and hide it and by and by when im away down the river ill write a letter and tell mary jane where its hid but i better hive it tonight if i can because the doctor maybe hasnt let up as much as he lets on he has he might scare them out of here yet so thinks i ill go and search them rooms upstairs the hall was dark but i found the dukes room and started to paw around it with my hands but i recollected it wouldnt be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self so then i went to his room and begun to paw around there but i see i couldnt do nothing without a candle and i dasnt light one of course so i judged id got to do the other thinglay for them and eavesdrop about that time i hears their footsteps coming and was going to skip under the bed i reached for it but it wasnt where i thought it would be but i touched the curtain that hid mary janes frocks so i jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns and stood there perfectly still they come in and shut the door and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed then i was glad i hadnt found the bed when i wanted it and yet you know its kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private they sets down then and the king says well what is it and cut it middlin short because its better for us to be down there awhoopin up the mournin than up here givin em a chance to talk us over well this is it capet i aint easy i aint comfortable that doctor lays on my mind i wanted to know your plans ive got a notion and i think its a sound one what is it duke that we better glide out of this before three in the morning and clip it down the river with what weve got specially seeing we got it so easygiven back to us flung at our heads as you may say when of course we allowed to have to steal it back im for knocking off and lighting out that made me feel pretty bad about an hour or two ago it would a been a little different but now it made me feel bad and disappointed the king rips out and says what and not sell out the rest o the property march off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thousn dollars worth o property layin around jest sufferin to be scooped inand all good salable stuff too the duke he grumbled said the bag of gold was enough and he didnt want to go no deeperdidnt want to rob a lot of orphans of everything they had why how you talk says the king we shant rob em of nothing at all but jest this money the people that buys the property is the suffrers because as soon s its found out at we didnt own itwhich wont be long after weve slidthe sale wont be valid and it ll all go back to the estate these yer orphans ll git their house back agin and thats enough for them theyre young and spry and kn easy earn a livin they aint agoin to suffer why jest thinktheres thousns and thousns that aint nigh so well off bless you they aint got nothn to complain of well the king he talked him blind so at last he give in and said all right but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay and that doctor hanging over them but the king says cuss the doctor what do we kyer for him haint we got all the fools in town on our side and aint that a big enough majority in any town so they got ready to go down stairs again the duke says i dont think we put that money in a good place that cheered me up id begun to think i warnt going to get a hint of no kind to help me the king says why because mary jane ll be in mourning from this out and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put em away and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it your heads level agin duke says the king and he comes afumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where i was i stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still though quivery and i wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me and i tried to think what id better do if they did catch me but the king he got the bag before i could think more than about a half a thought and he never suspicioned i was around they took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the featherbed and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now because a nigger only makes up the featherbed and dont turn over the straw tick only about twice a year and so it warnt in no danger of getting stole now but i knowed better i had it out of there before they was halfway down stairs i groped along up to my cubby and hid it there till i could get a chance to do better i judged i better hide it outside of the house somewheres because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking i knowed that very well then i turned in with my clothes all on but i couldnt a gone to sleep if id a wanted to i was in such a sweat to get through with the business by and by i heard the king and the duke come up so i rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder and waited to see if anything was going to happen but nothing did so i held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadnt begun yet and then i slipped down the ladder chapter xxvii i crept to their doors and listened they was snoring so i tiptoed along and got down stairs all right there warnt a sound anywheres i peeped through a crack of the diningroom door and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs the door was open into the parlor where the corpse was laying and there was a candle in both rooms i passed along and the parlor door was open but i see there warnt nobody in there but the remainders of peter so i shoved on by but the front door was locked and the key wasnt there just then i heard somebody coming down the stairs back behind me i run in the parlor and took a swift look around and the only place i see to hide the bag was in the coffin the lid was shoved along about a foot showing the dead mans face down in there with a wet cloth over it and his shroud on i tucked the moneybag in under the lid just down beyond where his hands was crossed which made me creep they was so cold and then i run back across the room and in behind the door the person coming was mary jane she went to the coffin very soft and kneeled down and looked in then she put up her handkerchief and i see she begun to cry though i couldnt hear her and her back was to me i slid out and as i passed the diningroom i thought id make sure them watchers hadnt seen me so i looked through the crack and everything was all right they hadnt stirred i slipped up to bed feeling ruther blue on accounts of the thing playing out that way after i had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it says i if it could stay where it is all right because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two i could write back to mary jane and she could dig him up again and get it but that aint the thing thats going to happen the thing thats going to happen is the money ll be found when they come to screw on the lid then the king ll get it again and it ll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him of course i wanted to slide down and get it out of there but i dasnt try it every minute it was getting earlier now and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir and i might get catchedcatched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadnt hired me to take care of i dont wish to be mixed up in no such business as that i says to myself when i got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up and the watchers was gone there warnt nobody around but the family and the widow bartley and our tribe i watched their faces to see if anything had been happening but i couldnt tell towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs and then set all our chairs in rows and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the diningroom was full i see the coffin lid was the way it was before but i dasnt go to look in under it with folks around then the people begun to flock in and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin and for a half an hour the people filed around slow in single rank and looked down at the dead mans face a minute and some dropped in a tear and it was all very still and solemn only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent and sobbing a little there warnt no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing nosesbecause people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church when the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways putting on the last touches and getting people and things all shipshape and comfortable and making no more sound than a cat he never spoke he moved people around he squeezed in late ones he opened up passageways and done it with nods and signs with his hands then he took his place over against the wall he was the softest glidingest stealthiest man i ever see and there warnt no more smile to him than there is to a ham they had borrowed a melodeuma sick one and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it and it was pretty skreeky and colicky and everybody joined in and sung and peter was the only one that had a good thing according to my notion then the reverend hobson opened up slow and solemn and begun to talk and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard it was only one dog but he made a most powerful racket and he kept it up right along the parson he had to stand there over the coffin and waityou couldnt hear yourself think it was right down awkward and nobody didnt seem to know what to do but pretty soon they see that longlegged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say dont you worryjust depend on me then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall just his shoulders showing over the peoples heads so he glided along and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time and at last when he had gone around two sides of the room he disappears down cellar then in about two seconds we heard a whack and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two and then everything was dead still and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off in a minute or two here comes this undertakers back and shoulders gliding along the wall again and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room and then rose up and shaded his mouth with his hands and stretched his neck out towards the preacher over the peoples heads and says in a kind of a coarse whisper he had a rat then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place you could see it was a great satisfaction to the people because naturally they wanted to know a little thing like that dont cost nothing and its just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked there warnt no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was well the funeral sermon was very good but pison long and tiresome and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage and at last the job was through and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screwdriver i was in a sweat then and watched him pretty keen but he never meddled at all just slid the lid along as soft as mush and screwed it down tight and fast so there i was i didnt know whether the money was in there or not so says i spose somebody has hogged that bag on the slynow how do i know whether to write to mary jane or not spose she dug him up and didnt find nothing what would she think of me blame it i says i might get hunted up and jailed id better lay low and keep dark and not write at all the things awful mixed now trying to better it ive worsened it a hundred times and i wish to goodness id just let it alone dad fetch the whole business they buried him and we come back home and i went to watching faces againi couldnt help it and i couldnt rest easy but nothing come of it the faces didnt tell me nothing the king he visited around in the evening and sweetened everybody up and made himself ever so friendly and he give out the idea that his congregation over in england would be in a sweat about him so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home he was very sorry he was so pushed and so was everybody they wished he could stay longer but they said they could see it couldnt be done and he said of course him and william would take the girls home with them and that pleased everybody too because then the girls would be well fixed and amongst their own relations and it pleased the girls tootickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to they would be ready them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so but i didnt see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune well blamed if the king didnt bill the house and the niggers and all the property for auction straight offsale two days after the funeral but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to so the next day after the funeral along about noontime the girls joy got the first jolt a couple of nigger traders come along and the king sold them the niggers reasonable for threeday drafts as they called it and away they went the two sons up the river to memphis and their mother down the river to orleans i thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief they cried around each other and took on so it most made me down sick to see it the girls said they hadnt ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town i cant ever get it out of my memory the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each others necks and crying and i reckon i couldnt a stood it all but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if i hadnt knowed the sale warnt no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two the thing made a big stir in the town too and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way it injured the frauds some but the old fool he bulled right along spite of all the duke could say or do and i tell you the duke was powerful uneasy next day was auction day about broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up and i see by their look that there was trouble the king says was you in my room night before last no your majestywhich was the way i always called him when nobody but our gang warnt around was you in there yisterday er last night no your majesty honor bright nowno lies honor bright your majesty im telling you the truth i haint been anear your room since miss mary jane took you and the duke and showed it to you the duke says have you seen anybody else go in there no your grace not as i remember i believe stop and think i studied awhile and see my chance then i says well i see the niggers go in there several times both of them gave a little jump and looked like they hadnt ever expected it and then like they had then the duke says what all of them noleastways not all at oncethat is i dont think i ever see them all come out at once but just one time hello when was that it was the day we had the funeral in the morning it warnt early because i overslept i was just starting down the ladder and i see them well go on go on what did they do howd they act they didnt do nothing and they didnt act anyway much as fur as i see they tiptoed away so i seen easy enough that theyd shoved in there to do up your majestys room or something sposing you was up and found you warnt up and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up if they hadnt already waked you up great guns this is a go says the king and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly they stood there athinking and scratching their heads a minute and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle and says it does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand they let on to be sorry they was going out of this region and i believed they was sorry and so did you and so did everybody dont ever tell me any more that a nigger aint got any histrionic talent why the way they played that thing it would fool anybody in my opinion theres a fortune in em if i had capital and a theater i wouldnt want a better layout than thatand here weve gone and sold em for a song yes and aint privileged to sing the song yet say where is that songthat draft in the bank for to be collected where would it be well thats all right then thank goodness says i kind of timidlike is something gone wrong the king whirls on me and rips out none o your business you keep your head shet and mind yr own affairsif you got any long as youre in this town dont you forgit thatyou hear then he says to the duke we got to jest swaller it and say nothn mums the word for us as they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again and says quick sales and small profits its a good businessyes the king snarls around on him and says i was trying to do for the best in sellin em out so quick if the profits has turned out to be none lackin considable and none to carry is it my fault any moren its yourn well theyd be in this house yet and we wouldnt if i could a got my advice listened to the king sassed back as much as was safe for him and then swapped around and lit into me again he give me down the banks for not coming and telling him i see the niggers come out of his room acting that waysaid any fool would a knowed something was up and then waltzed in and cussed himself awhile and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning and hed be blamed if hed ever do it again so they went off ajawing and i felt dreadful glad id worked it all off on to the niggers and yet hadnt done the niggers no harm by it chapter xxviii by and by it was gettingup time so i come down the ladder and started for downstairs but as i come to the girls room the door was open and i see mary jane setting by her old hair trunk which was open and shed been packing things in itgetting ready to go to england but she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap and had her face in her hands crying i felt awful bad to see it of course anybody would i went in there and says miss mary jane you cant abear to see people in trouble and i cant most always tell me about it so she done it and it was the niggersi just expected it she said the beautiful trip to england was most about spoiled for her she didnt know how she was ever going to be happy there knowing the mother and the children warnt ever going to see each other no moreand then busted out bitterer than ever and flung up her hands and says oh dear dear to think they aint ever going to see each other any more but they willand inside of two weeksand i know it says i laws it was out before i could think and before i could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it again say it again say it again i see i had spoke too sudden and said too much and was in a close place i asked her to let me think a minute and she set there very impatient and excited and handsome but looking kind of happy and easedup like a person thats had a tooth pulled out so i went to studying it out i says to myself i reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks though i aint had no experience and cant say for certain but it looks so to me anyway and yet heres a case where im blest if it dont look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer than a lie i must lay it by in my mind and think it over some time or other its so kind of strange and unregular i never see nothing like it well i says to myself at last im agoing to chance it ill up and tell the truth this time though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where youll go to then i says miss mary jane is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days yes mr lothrops why never mind why yet if ill tell you how i know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weekshere in this houseand prove how i know itwill you go to mr lothrops and stay four days four days she says ill stay a year all right i says i dont want nothing more out of you than just your wordi druther have it than another mans kissthebible she smiled and reddened up very sweet and i says if you dont mind it ill shut the doorand bolt it then i come back and set down again and says dont you holler just set still and take it like a man i got to tell the truth and you want to brace up miss mary because its a bad kind and going to be hard to take but there aint no help for it these uncles of yourn aint no uncles at all theyre a couple of frauds regular deadbeats there now were over the worst of it you can stand the rest middling easy it jolted her up like everything of course but i was over the shoal water now so i went right along her eyes ablazing higher and higher all the time and told her every blame thing from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat clear through to where she flung herself on to the kings breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen timesand then up she jumps with her face afire like sunset and says the brute come dont waste a minutenot a secondwell have them tarred and feathered and flung in the river says i certnly but do you mean before you go to mr lothrops or oh she says what am i thinking about she says and set right down again dont mind what i saidplease dontyou wont now will you laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way

be all right but thered be another person that you dont know about whod be in big trouble well we got to save him haint we of course well then we wont blow on them saying them words put a good idea in my head i see how maybe i could get me and jim rid of the frauds get them jailed here and then leave but i didnt want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me

remember her crying there all by herself in the night and them devils laying there right under her own roof shaming her and robbing her and when i folded it up and give it to her i see the water come into her eyes too and she shook me by the hand hard and says goodbye im going to do everything just as youve told me and if i dont ever see you again i shant ever forget you and ill think of you a many and a many a time and ill pray for you tooand she was gone pray for me i reckoned if she knowed me shed take a job that was more nearer her size but i bet she done it just the sameshe was just that kind she had the grit to pray for judus if she took the notionthere warnt no backdown to her i judge you may say what you want to but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl i ever see in my opinion she was just full of sand it sounds like flattery but it aint no flattery and when it comes to beautyand goodness tooshe lays over them all i haint ever seen her since that time that i see her go out of that door no i haint ever seen her since but i reckon ive thought of her a many and a many a million times and of her saying she would pray for me and if ever id a thought it would do any good for me to pray for her blamed if i wouldnt a done it or bust well mary jane she lit out the back way i reckon because nobody see her go when i struck susan and the harelip i says whats the name of them people over on tother side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes they says theres several but its the proctors mainly thats the name i says i most forgot it well miss mary jane she told me to tell you shes gone over there in a dreadful hurryone of thems sick which one i dont know leastways i kinder forget but i thinks its sakes alive i hope it aint hanner im sorry to say it i says but hanners the very one my goodness and she so well only last week is she took bad it aint no name for it they set up with her all night miss mary jane said and they dont think shell last many hours only think of that now whats the matter with her i couldnt think of anything reasonable right off that way so i says mumps mumps your granny they dont set up with people thats got the mumps they dont dont they you better bet they do with these mumps these mumps is different its a new kind miss mary jane said hows it a new kind because its mixed up with other things what other things well measles and whoopingcough and erysiplas and consumption and yaller janders and brainfever and i dont know what all my land and they call it the mumps thats what miss mary jane said well what in the nation do they call it the mumps for why because it is the mumps thats what it starts with well ther aint no sense in it a body might stump his toe and take pison and fall down the well and break his neck and bust his brains out and somebody come along and ask what killed him and some numskull up and say why he stumped his toe would ther be any sense in that no and ther aint no sense in this nuther is it ketching is it ketching why how you talk is a harrow catchingin the dark if you dont hitch on to one tooth youre bound to on another aint you and you cant get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along can you well these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow as you may sayand it aint no slouch of a harrow nuther you come to get it hitched on good well its awful i think says the harelip ill go to uncle harvey and oh yes i says i would of course i would i wouldnt lose no time well why wouldnt you just look at it a minute and maybe you can see haint your uncles obleegd to get along home to england as fast as they can and do you reckon theyd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves you know theyll wait for you so fur so good your uncle harveys a preacher aint he very well then is a preacher going to deceive a steamboat clerk is he going to deceive a ship clerk so as to get them to let miss mary jane go aboard now you know he aint what will he do then why hell say its a great pity but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribusunum mumps and so its my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if shes got it but never mind if you think its best to tell your uncle harvey shucks and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in england whilst we was waiting to find out whether mary janes got it or not why you talk like a muggins well anyway maybe youd better tell some of the neighbors listen at that now you do beat all for natural stupidness cant you see that theyd go and tell ther aint no way but just to not tell anybody at all well maybe youre rightyes i judge you are right but i reckon we ought to tell uncle harvey shes gone out a while anyway so he wont be uneasy about her yes miss mary jane she wanted you to do that she says tell them to give uncle harvey and william my love and a kiss and say ive run over the river to see mrmrwhat is the name of that rich family your uncle peter used to think so much ofi mean the one that why you must mean the apthorps aint it of course bother them kind of names a body cant ever seem to remember them half the time somehow yes she said say she has run over for to ask the apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house because she allowed her uncle peter would ruther they had it than anybody else and shes going to stick to them till they say theyll come and then if she aint too tired shes coming home and if she is shell be home in the morning anyway she said dont say nothing about the proctors but only about the apthorpswhich ll be perfectly true because she is going there to speak about their buying the house i know it because she told me so herself all right they said and cleared out to lay for their uncles and give them the love and the kisses and tell them the message everything was all right now the girls wouldnt say nothing because they wanted to go to england and the king and the duke would ruther mary jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of doctor robinson i felt very good i judged i had done it pretty neati reckoned tom sawyer couldnt a done it no neater himself of course he would a throwed more style into it but i cant do that very handy not being brung up to it well they held the auction in the public square along towards the end of the afternoon and it strung along and strung along and the old man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest up there longside of the auctioneer and chipping in a little scripture now and then or a little goodygoody saying of some kind and the duke he was around googooing for sympathy all he knowed how and just spreading himself generly but by and by the thing dragged through and everything was sold everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard so theyd got to work that offi never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow everything well whilst they was at it a steamboat landed and in about two minutes up comes a crowd awhooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on and singing out heres your opposition line heres your two sets o heirs to old peter wilksand you pays your money and you takes your choice chapter xxix they was fetching a very nicelooking old gentleman along and a nicelooking younger one with his right arm in a sling and my souls how the people yelled and laughed and kept it up but i didnt see no joke about it and i judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any i reckoned theyd turn pale but no nary a pale did they turn the duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up but just went a googooing around happy and satisfied like a jug thats googling out buttermilk and as for the king he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them newcomers like it give him the stomachache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world oh he done it admirable lots of the principal people gethered around the king to let him see they was on his side that old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death pretty soon he begun to speak and i see straight off he pronounced like an englishmannot the kings way though the kings was pretty good for an imitation i cant give the old gents words nor i cant imitate him but he turned around to the crowd and says about like this this is a surprise to me which i wasnt looking for and ill acknowledge candid and frank i aint very well fixed to meet it and answer it for my brother and me has had misfortunes hes broke his arm and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake i am peter wilks brother harvey and this is his brother william which cant hear nor speakand cant even make signs to amount to much nowt hes only got one hand to work them with we are who we say we are and in a day or two when i get the baggage i can prove it but up till then i wont say nothing more but go to the hotel and wait so him and the new dummy started off and the king he laughs and blethers out broke his armvery likely aint itand very convenient too for a fraud thats got to make signs and aint learnt how lost their baggage thats mighty goodand mighty ingeniousunder the circumstances so he laughed again and so did everybody else except three or four or maybe half a dozen one of these was that doctor another one was a sharplooking gentleman with a carpetbag of the oldfashioned kind made out of carpetstuff that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their headsit was levi bell the lawyer that was gone up to louisville and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said and was listening to the king now and when the king got done this husky up and says say looky here if you are harvey wilks whend you come to this town the day before the funeral friend says the king but what time o day in the eveninbout an hour er two before sundown howd you come i come down on the susan powell from cincinnati well then howd you come to be up at the pint in the morninin a canoe i warnt up at the pint in the mornin its a lie several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher preacher be hanged hes a fraud and a liar he was up at the pint that mornin i live up there dont i well i was up there and he was up there i see him there he come in a canoe along with tim collins and a boy the doctor he up and says would you know the boy again if you was to see him hines i reckon i would but i dont know why yonder he is now i know him perfectly easy it was me he pointed at the doctor says neighbors i dont know whether the new couple is frauds or not but if these two aint frauds i am an idiot thats all i think its our duty to see that they dont get away from here till weve looked into this thing come along hines come along the rest of you well take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with tother couple and i reckon well find out something before we get through it was nuts for the crowd though maybe not for the kings friends so we all started it was about sundown the doctor he led me along by the hand and was plenty kind enough but he never let go my hand we all got in a big room in the hotel and lit up some candles and fetched in the new couple first the doctor says i dont wish to be too hard on these two men but i think theyre frauds and they may have complices that we dont know nothing about if they have wont the complices get away with that bag of gold peter wilks left it aint unlikely if these men aint frauds they wont object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove theyre all rightaint that so everybody agreed to that so i judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart but the king he only looked sorrowful and says gentlemen i wish the money was there for i aint got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair open outandout investigation o this misable business but alas the money aint there you kn send and see if you want to where is it then well when my niece give it to me to keep for her i took and hid it inside o the straw tick o my bed not wishin to bank it for the few days wed be here and considerin the bed a safe place we not bein used to niggers and supposn em honest like servants in england the niggers stole it the very next mornin after i had went down stairs and when i sold em i hadnt missed the money yit so they got clean away with it my servant here kn tell you bout it gentlemen the doctor and several said shucks and i see nobody didnt altogether believe him one man asked me if i see the niggers steal it i said no but i see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away and i never thought nothing only i reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them that was all they asked me then the doctor whirls on me and says are you english too i says yes and him and some others laughed and said stuff well then they sailed in on the general investigation and there we had it up and down hour in hour out and nobody never said a word about supper nor ever seemed to think about itand so they kept it up and kept it up and it was the worst mixedup thing you ever see they made the king tell his yarn and they made the old gentleman tell hisn and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a seen that the old gentleman was spinning truth and tother one lies and by and by they had me up to tell what i knowed the king he give me a lefthanded look out of the corner of his eye and so i knowed enough to talk on the right side i begun to tell about sheffield and how we lived there and all about the english wilkses and so on but i didnt get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh and levi bell the lawyer says set down my boy i wouldnt strain myself if i was you i reckon you aint used to lying it dont seem to come handy what you want is practice you do it pretty awkward i didnt care nothing for the compliment but i was glad to be let off anyway the doctor he started to say something and turns and says if youd been in town at first levi bell the king broke in and reached out his hand and says why is this my poor dead brothers old friend that hes wrote so often about the lawyer and him shook hands and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased and they talked right along awhile and then got to one side and talked low and at last the lawyer speaks up and says that ll fix it ill take the order and send it along with your brothers and then theyll know its all right so they got some paper and a pen and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side and chawed his tongue and scrawled off something and then they give the pen to the dukeand then for the first time the duke looked sick but he took the pen and wrote so then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says you and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names the old gentleman wrote but nobody couldnt read it the lawyer looked powerful astonished and says well it beats meand snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket and examined them and then examined the old mans writing and then them again and then says these old letters is from harvey wilks and heres these two handwritings and anybody can see they didnt write them the king and the duke looked sold and foolish i tell you to see how the lawyer had took them in and heres this old gentlemans hand writing and anybody can tell easy enough he didnt write themfact is the scratches he makes aint properly writing at all now heres some letters from the new old gentleman says if you please let me explain nobody can read my hand but my brother thereso he copies for me its his hand youve got there not mine well says the lawyer this is a state of things ive got some of williams letters too so if youll get him to write a line or so we can com he cant write with his left hand says the old gentleman if he could use his right hand you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too look at both pleasetheyre by the same hand the lawyer done it and says i believe its soand if it aint so theres a heap stronger resemblance than id noticed before anyway well well well i thought we was right on the track of a solution but its gone to grass partly but anyway one thing is provedthese two aint either of em wilksesand he wagged his head towards the king and the duke well what do you think that muleheaded old fool wouldnt give in then indeed he wouldnt said it warnt no fair test said his brother william was the cussedest joker in the world and hadnt tried to write he see william was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper and so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying himself but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in and says ive thought of something is there anybody here that helped to lay out my brhelped to lay out the late peter wilks for burying yes says somebody me and ab turner done it were both here then the old man turns towards the king and says perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast blamed if the king didnt have to brace up mighty quick or hed a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under it took him so sudden and mind you it was a thing that was calculated to make most anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice because how was he going to know what was tattooed on the man he whitened a little he couldnt help it and it was mighty still in there and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him says i to myself now hell throw up the spongethere aint no more use well did he a body cant hardly believe it but he didnt i reckon he thought hed keep the thing up till he tired them people out so theyd thin out and him and the duke could break loose and get away anyway he set there and pretty soon he begun to smile and says mf its a very tough question aint it yes sir i kn tell you whats tattooed on his breast its jest a small thin blue arrow thats what it is and if you dont look clost you cant see it now what do you sayhey well i never see anything like that old blister for clean outandout cheek the new old gentleman turns brisk towards ab turner and his pard and his eye lights up like he judged hed got the king this time and says thereyouve heard what he said was there any such mark on peter wilks breast both of them spoke up and says we didnt see no such mark good says the old gentleman now what you did see on his breast was a small dim p and a b which is an initial he dropped when he was young and a w with dashes between them so pbwand he marked them that way on a piece of paper come aint that what you saw both of them spoke up again and says no we didnt we never seen any marks at all well everybody was in a state of mind now and they sings out the whole bilin of m s frauds les duck em les drown em les ride em on a rail and everybody was whooping at once and there was a rattling powwow but the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells and says gentlemengentlemen hear me just a wordjust a single wordif you please theres one way yetlets go and dig up the corpse and look that took them hooray they all shouted and was starting right off but the lawyer and the doctor sung out hold on hold on collar all these four men and the boy and fetch them along too well do it they all shouted and if we dont find them marks well lynch the whole gang i was scared now i tell you but there warnt no getting away you know they gripped us all and marched us right along straight for the graveyard which was a mile and a half down the river and the whole town at our heels for we made noise enough and it was only nine in the evening as we went by our house i wished i hadnt sent mary jane out of town because now if i could tip her the wink shed light out and save me and blow on our deadbeats well we swarmed along down the river road just carrying on like wildcats and to make it more scary the sky was darking up and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves this was the most awful trouble and most dangersome i ever was in and i was kinder stunned everything was going so different from what i had allowed for stead of being fixed so i could take my own time if i wanted to and see all the fun and have mary jane at my back to save me and set me free when the closefit come here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoomarks if they didnt find them i couldnt bear to think about it and yet somehow i couldnt think about nothing else it got darker and darker and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip but that big husky had me by the wrist hinesand a body might as well try to give goliar the slip he dragged me right along he was so excited and i had to run to keep up when they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow and when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted but nobody hadnt thought to fetch a lantern but they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning and sent a man to the nearest house a half a mile off to borrow one so they dug and dug like everything and it got awful dark and the rain started and the wind swished and swushed along and the lightning come brisker and brisker and the thunder boomed but them people never took no notice of it they was so full of this business and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave and the next second the dark wiped it all out and you couldnt see nothing at all at last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was to scrouge in and get a sight you never see and in the dark that way it was awful hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so and i reckon he clean forgot i was in the world he was so excited and panting all of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare and somebody sings out by the living jingo heres the bag of gold on his breast hines let out a whoop like everybody else and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look and the way i lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there aint nobody can tell i had the road all to myself and i fairly flewleastways i had it all to myself except the solid dark and the nowandthen glares and the buzzing of the rain and the thrashing of the wind and the splitting of the thunder and sure as you are born i did clip it along when i struck the town i see there warnt nobody out in the storm so i never hunted for no back streets but humped it straight through the main one and when i begun to get towards our house i aimed my eye and set it no light there the house all darkwhich made me feel sorry and disappointed i didnt know why but at last just as i was sailing by flash comes the light in mary janes window and my heart swelled up sudden like to bust and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark and wasnt ever going to be before me no more in this world she was the best girl i ever see and had the most sand the minute i was far enough above the town to see i could make the towhead i begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow and the first time the lightning showed me one that wasnt chained i snatched it and shoved it was a canoe and warnt fastened with nothing but a rope the towhead was a rattling big distance off away out there in the middle of the river but i didnt lose no time and when i struck the raft at last i was so fagged i would a just laid down to blow and gasp if i could afforded it but i didnt as i sprung aboard i sung out out with you jim and set her loose glory be to goodness were shut of them jim lit out and was acoming for me with both arms spread he was so full of joy but when i glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and i went overboard backwards for i forgot he was old king lear and a drownded arab all in one and it most scared the livers and lights out of me but jim fished me out and was going to hug me and bless me and so on he was so glad i was back and we was shut of the king and the duke but i says not now have it for breakfast have it for breakfast cut loose and let her slide so in two seconds away we went asliding down the river and it did seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river and nobody to bother us i had to skip around a bit and jump up and crack my heels a few timesi couldnt help it but about the third crack i noticed a sound that i knowed mighty well and held my breath and listened and waited and sure enough when the next flash busted out over the water here they comeand just alaying to their oars and making their skiff hum it was the king and the duke so i wilted right down on to the planks then and give up and it was all i could do to keep from crying chapter xxx when they got aboard the king went for me and shook me by the collar and says tryin to give us the slip was ye you pup tired of our company hey i says no your majesty we warntplease dont your majesty quick then and tell us what was your idea or ill shake the insides out o you honest ill tell you everything just as it happened your majesty the man that had aholt of me was very good to me and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold and made a rush for the coffin he lets go of me and whispers heel it now or theyll hang ye sure and i lit out it didnt seem no good for me to stayi couldnt do nothing and i didnt want to be hung if i could get away so i never stopped running till i found the canoe and when i got here i told jim to hurry or theyd catch me and hang me yet and said i was afeard you and the duke wasnt alive now and i was awful sorry and so was jim and was awful glad when we see you coming you may ask jim if i didnt jim said it was so and the king told him to shut up and said oh yes its mighty likely and shook me up again and said he reckoned hed drownd me but the duke says leggo the boy you old idiot would you a done any different did you inquire around for him when you got loose i dont remember it so the king let go of me and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it but the duke says you better a blame sight give yourself a good cussing for youre the one thats entitled to it most you haint done a thing from the start that had any sense in it except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary bluearrow mark that was brightit was right down bully and it was the thing that saved us for if it hadnt been for that theyd a jailed us till them englishmens baggage comeand thenthe penitentiary you bet but that trick took em to the graveyard and the gold done us a still bigger kindness for if the excited fools hadnt let go all holts and made that rush to get a look wed a slept in our cravats tonightcravats warranted to wear toolonger than wed need em they was still a minutethinking then the king says kind of absentminded like mf and we reckoned the niggers stole it that made me squirm yes says the duke kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic we did after about a half a minute the king drawls out leastways i did the duke says the same way on the contrary i did the king kind of ruffles up and says looky here bilgewater whatr you referrin to the duke says pretty brisk when it comes to that maybe youll let me ask what was you referring to shucks says the king very sarcastic but i dont knowmaybe you was asleep and didnt know what you was about the duke bristles up now and says oh let up on this cussed nonsense do you take me for a blame fool dont you reckon i know who hid that money in that coffin yes sir i know you do know because you done it yourself its a lieand the duke went for him the king sings out take yr hands offleggo my throati take it all back the duke says well you just own up first that you did hide that money there intending to give me the slip one of these days and come back and dig it up and have it all to yourself wait jest a minute dukeanswer me this one question honest and fair if you didnt put the money there say it and ill blieve you and take back everything i said you old scoundrel i didnt and you know i didnt there now well then i blieve you but answer me only jest this one morenow dont git mad didnt you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it the duke never said nothing for a little bit then he says well i dont care if i did i didnt do it anyway but you not only had it in mind to do it but you done it i wisht i never die if i done it duke and thats honest i wont say i warnt goin to do it because i was but youi mean somebodygot in ahead o me its a lie you done it and you got to say you done it or the king began to gurgle and then he gasps out noughi own up i was very glad to hear him say that it made me feel much more easier than what i was feeling before so the duke took his hands off and says if you ever deny it again ill drown you its well for you to set there and blubber like a babyits fitten for you after the way youve acted i never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything and i atrusting you all the time like you was my own father you ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers and you never say a word for em it makes me feel ridiculous to think i was soft enough to believe that rubbage cuss you i can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisityou wanted to get what money id got out of the nonesuch and one thing or another and scoop it all the king says timid and still asnuffling why duke it was you that said make up the deffisit it warnt me dry up i dont want to hear no more out of you says the duke and now you see what you got by it theyve got all their own money back and all of ourn but a shekel or two besides glong to bed and dont you deffersit me no more deffersits long s you live so the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort and before long the duke tackled his bottle and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again and the tighter they got the lovinger they got and went off asnoring in each others arms they both got powerful mellow but i noticed the king didnt get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the moneybag again that made me feel easy and satisfied of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble and i told jim everything chapter xxxi we dasnt stop again at any town for days and days kept right along down the river we was down south in the warm weather now and a mighty long ways from home we begun to come to trees with spanish moss on them hanging down from the limbs like long gray beards it was the first i ever see it growing and it made the woods look solemn and dismal so now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger and they begun to work the villages again first they done a lecture on temperance but they didnt make enough for them both to get drunk on then in another village they started a dancingschool but they didnt know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town another time they tried to go at yellocution but they didnt yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing and made them skip out they tackled missionarying and mesmerizing and doctoring and telling fortunes and a little of everything but they couldnt seem to have no luck so at last they got just about dead broke and laid around the raft as she floated along thinking and thinking and never saying nothing by the half a day at a time and dreadful blue and desperate and at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time jim and me got uneasy we didnt like the look of it we judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever we turned it over and over and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebodys house or store or was going into the counterfeitmoney business or something so then we was pretty scared and made up an agreement that we wouldnt have nothing in the world to do with such actions and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind well early one morning we hid the raft in a good safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named pikesville and the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the royal nonesuch there yet house to rob you mean says i to myself and when you get through robbing it youll come back here and wonder what has become of me and jim and the raftand youll have to take it out in wondering and he said if he warnt back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right and we was to come along so we stayed where we was the duke he fretted and sweated around and was in a mighty sour way he scolded us for everything and we couldnt seem to do nothing right he found fault with every little thing something was abrewing sure i was good and glad when midday come and no king we could have a change anywayand maybe a chance for the change on top of it so me and the duke went up to the village and hunted around there for the king and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery very tight and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport and he acussing and athreatening with all his might and so tight he couldnt walk and couldnt do nothing to them the duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool and the king begun to sass back and the minute they was fairly at it i lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs and spun down the river road like a deer for i see our chance and i made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and jim again i got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy and sung out set her loose jim were all right now but there warnt no answer and nobody come out of the wigwam jim was gone i set up a shoutand then anotherand then another one and run this way and that in the woods whooping and screeching but it warnt no useold jim was gone then i set down and cried i couldnt help it but i couldnt set still long pretty soon i went out on the road trying to think what i better do and i run across a boy walking and asked him if hed seen a strange nigger dressed so and so and he says yes whereabouts says i down to silas phelps place two mile below here hes a runaway nigger and theyve got him was you looking for him you bet i aint i run across him in the woods about an hour or two ago and he said if i hollered hed cut my livers outand told me to lay down and stay where i was and i done it been there ever since afeard to come out well he says you neednt be afeard no more becuz theyve got him he run off fm down south somers its a good job they got him well i reckon theres two hunderd dollars reward on him its like picking up money outn the road yes it isand i could a had it if id been big enough i see him first who nailed him it was an old fellowa strangerand he sold out his chance in him for forty dollars becuz hes got to go up the river and cant wait think o that now you bet id wait if it was seven year thats me every time says i but maybe his chance aint worth no more than that if hell sell it so cheap maybe theres something aint straight about it but it is thoughstraight as a string i see the handbill myself it tells all about him to a dotpaints him like a picture and tells the plantation hes frum below newrleans nosirreebob they aint no trouble bout that speculation you bet you say gimme a chaw tobacker wont ye i didnt have none so he left i went to the raft and set down in the wigwam to think but i couldnt come to nothing i thought till i wore my head sore but i couldnt see no way out of the trouble after all this long journey and after all wed done for them scoundrels here it was all come to nothing everything all busted up and ruined because they could have the heart to serve jim such a trick as that and make him a slave again all his life and amongst strangers too for forty dirty dollars once i said to myself it would be a thousand times better for jim to be a slave at home where his family was as long as hed got to be a slave and so id better write a letter to tom sawyer and tell him to tell miss watson where he was but i soon give up that notion for two things shed be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her and so shed sell him straight down the river again and if she didnt everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger and theyd make jim feel it all the time and so hed feel ornery and disgraced and then think of me it would get all around that huck finn helped a nigger to get his freedom and if i was ever to see anybody from that town again id be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame thats just the way a person does a lowdown thing and then he dont want to take no consequences of it thinks as long as he can hide it it aint no disgrace that was my fix exactly the more i studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me and the more wicked and lowdown and ornery i got to feeling and at last when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven whilst i was stealing a poor old womans nigger that hadnt ever done me no harm and now was showing me theres one thats always on the lookout and aint agoing to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further i most dropped in my tracks i was so scared well i tried the best i could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying i was brung up wicked and so i warnt so much to blame but something inside of me kept saying there was the sundayschool you could a gone to it and if youd a done it theyd a learnt you there that people that acts as id been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire it made me shiver and i about made up my mind to pray and see if i couldnt try to quit being the kind of a boy i was and be better so i kneeled down but the words wouldnt come why wouldnt they it warnt no use to try and hide it from him nor from me neither i knowed very well why they wouldnt come it was because my heart warnt right it was because i warnt square it was because i was playing double i was letting on to give up sin but away inside of me i was holding on to the biggest one of all i was trying to make my mouth say i would do the right thing and the clean thing and go and write to that niggers owner and tell where he was but deep down in me i knowed it was a lie and he knowed it you cant pray a liei found that out so i was full of trouble full as i could be and didnt know what to do at last i had an idea and i says ill go and write the letterand then see if i can pray why it was astonishing the way i felt as light as a feather right straight off and my troubles all gone so i got a piece of paper and a pencil all glad and excited and set down and wrote miss watson your runaway nigger jim is down here two mile below pikesville and mr phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send huck finn i felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time i had ever felt so in my life and i knowed i could pray now but i didnt do it straight off but laid the paper down and set there thinkingthinking how good it was all this happened so and how near i come to being lost and going to hell and went on thinking and got to thinking over our trip down the river and i see jim before me all the time in the day and in the nighttime sometimes moonlight sometimes storms and we afloating along talking and singing and laughing but somehow i couldnt seem to strike no places to harden me against him but only the other kind id see him standing my watch on top of hisn stead of calling me so i could go on sleeping and see him how glad he was when i come back out of the fog and when i come to him again in the swamp up there where the feud was and suchlike times and would always call me honey and pet me and do everything he could think of for me and how good he always was and at last i struck the time i saved him by telling the men we had smallpox aboard and he was so grateful and said i was the best friend old jim ever had in the world and the only one hes got now and then i happened to look around and see that paper it was a close place i took it up and held it in my hand i was atrembling because id got to decide forever betwixt two things and i knowed it i studied a minute sort of holding my breath and then says to myself all right then ill go to helland tore it up it was awful thoughts and awful words but they was said and i let them stay said and never thought no more about reforming i shoved the whole thing out of my head and said i would take up wickedness again which was in my line being brung up to it and the other warnt and for a starter i would go to work and steal jim out of slavery again and if i could think up anything worse i would do that too because as long as i was in and in for good i might as well go the whole hog then i set to thinking over how to get at it and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind and at last fixed up a plan that suited me so then i took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece and as soon as it was fairly dark i crept out with my raft and went for it and hid it there and then turned in i slept the night through and got up before it was light and had my breakfast and put on my store clothes and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle and took the canoe and cleared for shore i landed below where i judged was phelpss place and hid my bundle in the woods and then filled up the canoe with water and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where i could find her again when i wanted her about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank then i struck up the road and when i passed the mill i see a sign on it phelpss sawmill and when i come to the farmhouses two or three hundred yards further along i kept my eyes peeled but didnt see nobody around though it was good daylight now but i didnt mind because i didnt want to see nobody just yeti only wanted to get the lay of the land according to my plan i was going to turn up there from the village not from below so i just took a look and shoved along straight for town well the very first man i see when i got there was the duke he was sticking up a bill for the royal nonesuchthreenight performancelike that other time they had the cheek them frauds i was right on him before i could shirk he looked astonished and says hello whered you come from then he says kind of glad and eager wheres the raftgot her in a good place i says why thats just what i was going to ask your grace then he didnt look so joyful and says what was your idea for asking me he says well i says when i see the king in that doggery yesterday i says to myself we cant get him home for hours till hes soberer so i went aloafing around town to put in the time and wait a man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep and so i went along but when we was dragging him to the boat and the man left me aholt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run and we after him we didnt have no dog and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out we never got him till dark then we fetched him over and i started down for the raft when i got there and see it was gone i says to myself theyve got into trouble and had to leave and theyve took my nigger which is the only nigger ive got in the world and now im in a strange country and aint got no property no more nor nothing and no way to make my living so i set down and cried i slept in the woods all night but what did become of the raft thenand jimpoor jim blamed if i knowthat is whats become of the raft that old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched halfdollars with him and got every cent but what hed spent for whisky and when i got him home late last night and found the raft gone we said that little rascal has stole our raft and shook us and run off down the river i wouldnt shake my nigger would ithe only nigger i had in the world and the only property we never thought of that fact is i reckon wed come to consider him our nigger yes we did consider him sogoodness knows we had trouble enough for him so when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke there warnt anything for it but to try the royal nonesuch another shake and ive pegged along ever since dry as a powderhorn wheres that ten cents give it here i had considerable money so i give him ten cents but begged him to spend it for something to eat and give me some because it was all the money i had and i hadnt had nothing to eat since yesterday he never said nothing the next minute he whirls on me and says do you reckon that nigger would blow on us wed skin him if he done that how can he blow haint he run off no that old fool sold him and never divided with me and the moneys gone sold him i says and begun to cry why he was my nigger and that was my money where is hei want my nigger well you cant get your nigger thats allso dry up your blubbering looky heredo you think youd venture to blow on us blamed if i think id trust you why if you was to blow on us he stopped but i never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before i went on awhimpering and says i dont want to blow on nobody and i aint got no time to blow nohow i got to turn out and find my nigger he looked kinder bothered and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm thinking and wrinkling up his forehead at last he says ill tell you something we got to be here three days if youll promise you wont blow and wont let the nigger blow ill tell you where to find him so i promised and he says a farmer by the name of silas ph and then he stopped you see he started to tell me the truth but when he stopped that way and begun to study and think again i reckoned he was changing his mind and so he was he wouldnt trust me he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days so pretty soon he says the man that bought him is named abram fosterabram g fosterand he lives forty mile back here in the country on the road to lafayette all right i says i can walk it in three days and ill start this very afternoon no you wont youll start now and dont you lose any time about it neither nor do any gabbling by the way just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along and then you wont get into trouble with us dye hear that was the order i wanted and that was the one i played for i wanted to be left free to work my plans so clear out he says and you can tell mr foster whatever you want to maybe you can get him to believe that jim is your niggersome idiots dont require documentsleastways ive heard theres such down south here and when you tell him the handbill and the rewards bogus maybe hell believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting em out go long now and tell him anything you want to but mind you dont work your jaw any between here and there so i left and struck for the back country i didnt look around but i kinder felt like he was watching me but i knowed i could tire him out at that i went straight out in the country as much as a mile before i stopped then i doubled back through the woods towards phelps i reckoned i better start in on my plan straight off without fooling around because i wanted to stop jims mouth till these fellows could get away i didnt want no trouble with their kind id seen all i wanted to of them and wanted to get entirely shut of them chapter xxxii when i got there it was all still and sundaylike and hot and sunshiny the hands was gone to the fields and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybodys dead and gone and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful because you feel like its spirits whisperingspirits thats been dead ever so many yearsand you always think theyre talking about you as a general thing it makes a body wish he was dead too and done with it all phelps was one of these little onehorse cotton plantations and they all look alike a rail fence round a twoacre yard a stile made out of logs sawed off and upended in steps like barrels of a different length to climb over the fence with and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a horse some sickly grasspatches in the big yard but mostly it was bare and smooth like an old hat with the nap rubbed off big double loghouse for the white folkshewed logs with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar and these mudstripes been whitewashed some time or another roundlog kitchen with a big broad open but roofed passage joining it to the house log smokehouse back of the kitchen three little log niggercabins in a row tother side the smokehouse one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence and some outbuildings down a piece the other side ashhopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut bench by the kitchen door with bucket of water and a gourd hound asleep there in the sun more hounds asleep round about about three shade trees away off in a corner some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch then the cotton fields begins and after the fields the woods i went around and clumb over the back stile by the ashhopper and started for the kitchen when i got a little ways i heard the dim hum of a spinningwheel wailing along up and sinking along down again and then i knowed for certain i wished i was deadfor that is the lonesomest sound in the whole world i went right along not fixing up any particular plan but just trusting to providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come for id noticed that providence always did put the right words in my mouth if i left it alone when i got halfway first one hound and then another got up and went for me and of course i stopped and faced them and kept still and such another powwow as they made in a quarter of a minute i was a kind of a hub of a wheel as you may sayspokes made out of dogscircle of fifteen of them packed together around me with their necks and noses stretched up towards me abarking and howling and more acoming you could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres a nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rollingpin in her hand singing out begone you tige you spot begone sah and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling and then the rest followed and the next second half of them come back wagging their tails around me and making friends with me there aint no harm in a hound nohow and behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without anything on but towlinen shirts and they hung on to their mothers gown and peeped out from behind her at me bashful the way they always do and here comes the white woman running from the house about fortyfive or fifty year old bareheaded and her spinningstick in her hand and behind her comes her little white children acting the same way the little niggers was doing she was smiling all over so she could hardly standand says its you at lastaint it i out with a yesm before i thought she grabbed me and hugged me tight and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook and the tears come in her eyes and run down over and she couldnt seem to hug and shake enough and kept saying you dont look as much like your mother as i reckoned you would but law sakes i dont care for that im so glad to see you dear dear it does seem like i could eat you up children its your cousin tomtell him howdy but they ducked their heads and put their fingers in their mouths and hid behind her so she run on lize hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right awayor did you get your breakfast on the boat i said i had got it on the boat so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after when we got there she set me down in a splitbottomed chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says now i can have a good look at you and lawsame ive been hungry for it a many and a many a time all these long years and its come at last we been expecting you a couple of days and more what kep youboat get aground yesmshe dont say yesmsay aunt sally whered she get aground i didnt rightly know what to say because i didnt know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down but i go a good deal on instinct and my instinct said she would be coming upfrom down towards orleans that didnt help me much though for i didnt know the names of bars down that way i see id got to invent a bar or forget the name of the one we got aground onornow i struck an idea and fetched it out it warnt the groundingthat didnt keep us back but a little we blowed out a cylinderhead good gracious anybody hurt nom killed a nigger well its lucky because sometimes people do get hurt two years ago last christmas your uncle silas was coming up from newrleans on the old lally rook and she blowed out a cylinderhead and crippled a man and i think he died afterwards he was a baptist your uncle silas knowed a family in baton rouge that knowed his people very well yes i remember now he did die mortification set in and they had to amputate him but it didnt save him yes it was mortificationthat was it he turned blue all over and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection they say he was a sight to look at your uncles been up to the town every day to fetch you and hes gone again not moren an hour ago hell be back any minute now you must a met him on the road didnt youoldish man with a no i didnt see nobody aunt sally the boat landed just at daylight and i left my baggage on the wharfboat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country to put in the time and not get here too soon and so i come down the back way whod you give the baggage to nobody why child it ll be stole not where i hid it i reckon it wont i says howd you get your breakfast so early on the boat it was kinder thin ice but i says the captain see me standing around and told me i better have something to eat before i went ashore so he took me in the texas to the officers lunch and give me all i wanted i was getting so uneasy i couldnt listen good i had my mind on the children all the time i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little and find out who i was but i couldnt get no show mrs phelps kept it up and run on so pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back because she says but here were arunning on this way and you haint told me a word about sis nor any of them now ill rest my works a little and you start up yourn just tell me everythingtell me all about m all every one of m and how they are and what theyre doing and what they told you to tell me and every last thing you can think of well i see i was up a stumpand up it good providence had stood by me this fur all right but i was hard and tight aground now i see it warnt a bit of use to try to go aheadid got to throw up my hand so i says to myself heres another place where i got to resk the truth i opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here he comes stick your head down lowerthere thatll do you cant be seen now dont you let on youre here ill play a joke on him children dont you say a word i see i was in a fix now but it warnt no use to worry there warnt nothing to do but just hold still and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck i had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in then the bed hid him mrs phelps she jumps for him and says has he come no says her husband goodness gracious she says what in the warld can have become of him i cant imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy uneasy she says im ready to go distracted he must a come and youve missed him along the road i know its sosomething tells me so why sally i couldnt miss him along the roadyou know that but oh dear dear what will sis say he must a come you must a missed him he oh dont distress me any moren im already distressed i dont know what in the world to make of it im at my wits end and i dont mind acknowledging t im right down scared but theres no hope that hes come for he couldnt come and me miss him sally its terriblejust terriblesomethings happened to the boat sure why silas look yonderup the roadaint that somebody coming he sprung to the window at the head of the bed and that give mrs phelps the chance she wanted she stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull and out i come and when he turned back from the window there she stood abeaming and asmiling like a house afire and i standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside the old gentleman stared and says why whos that who do you reckon t is i haint no idea who is it its tom sawyer by jings i most slumped through the floor but there warnt no time to swap knives the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook and kept on shaking and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry and then how they both did fire off questions about sid and mary and the rest of the tribe but if they was joyful it warnt nothing to what i was for it was like being born again i was so glad to find out who i was well they froze to me for two hours and at last when my chin was so tired it couldnt hardly go any more i had told them more about my familyi mean the sawyer familythan ever happened to any six sawyer families and i explained all about how we blowed out a cylinderhead at the mouth of white river and it took us three days to fix it which was all right and worked firstrate because they didnt know but what it would take three days to fix it if id a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well now i was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side and pretty uncomfortable all up the other being tom sawyer was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coughing along down the river then i says to myself spose tom sawyer comes down on that boat and spose he steps in here any minute and sings out my name before i can throw him a wink to keep quiet well i couldnt have it that way it wouldnt do at all i must go up the road and waylay him so i told the folks i reckoned i would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage the old gentleman was for going along with me but i said no i could drive the horse myself and i druther he wouldnt take no trouble about me chapter xxxiii so i started for town in the wagon and when i was halfway i see a wagon coming and sure enough it was tom sawyer and i stopped and waited till he come along i says hold on and it stopped alongside and his mouth opened up like a trunk and stayed so and he swallowed two or three times like a person thats got a dry throat and then says i haint ever done you no harm you know that so then what you want to come back and hant me for i says i haint come backi haint been gone when he heard my voice it righted him up some but he warnt quite satisfied yet he says dont you play nothing on me because i wouldnt on you honest injun now you aint a ghost honest injun i aint i says welliiwell that ought to settle it of course but i cant somehow seem to understand it no way looky here warnt you ever murdered at all no i warnt ever murdered at alli played it on them you come in here and feel of me if you dont believe me so he done it and it satisfied him and he was that glad to see me again he didnt know what to do and he wanted to know all about it right off because it was a grand adventure and mysterious and so it hit him where he lived but i said leave it alone till by and by and told his driver to wait and we drove off a little piece and i told him the kind of a fix i was in and what did he reckon we better do he said let him alone a minute and dont disturb him so he thought and thought and pretty soon he says its all right ive got it take my trunk in your wagon and let on its yourn and you turn back and fool along slow so as to get to the house about the time you ought to and ill go towards town a piece and take a fresh start and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you and you neednt let on to know me at first i says all right but wait a minute theres one more thinga thing that nobody dont know but me and that is theres a nigger here that im atrying to steal out of slavery and his name is jimold miss watsons jim he says what why jim is he stopped and went to studying i says i know what youll say youll say its dirty lowdown business but what if it is im low down and im agoing to steal him and i want you keep mum and not let on will you his eye lit up and he says ill help you steal him well i let go all holts then like i was shot it was the most astonishing speech i ever heardand im bound to say tom sawyer fell considerable in my estimation only i couldnt believe it tom sawyer a niggerstealer oh shucks i says youre joking i aint joking either well then i says joking or no joking if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger dont forget to remember that you dont know nothing about him and i dont know nothing about him then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon and he drove off his way and i drove mine but of course i forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking so i got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip the old gentleman was at the door and he says why this is wonderful whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it i wish wed a timed her and she haint sweated a hairnot a hair its wonderful why i wouldnt take a hundred dollars for that horse nowi wouldnt honest and yet id a sold her for fifteen before and thought twas all she was worth thats all he said he was the innocentest best old soul i ever see but it warnt surprising because he warnt only just a farmer he was a preacher too and had a little onehorse log church down back of the plantation which he built it himself at his own expense for a church and schoolhouse and never charged nothing for his preaching and it was worth it too there was plenty other farmerpreachers like that and done the same way down south in about half an hour toms wagon drove up to the front stile and aunt sally she see it through the window because it was only about fifty yards and says why theres somebody come i wonder who tis why i do believe its a stranger jimmy thats one of the children run and tell lize to put on another plate for dinner everybody made a rush for the front door because of course a stranger dont come every year and so he lays over the yallerfever for interest when he does come tom was over the stile and starting for the house the wagon was spinning up the road for the village and we was all bunched in the front door tom had his store clothes on and an audienceand that was always nuts for tom sawyer in them circumstances it warnt no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable he warnt a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep no he come cam and important like the ram when he got afront of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didnt want to disturb them and says mr archibald nichols i presume no my boy says the old gentleman im sorry to say t your driver has deceived you nicholss place is down a matter of three mile more come in come in tom he took a look back over his shoulder and says too latehes out of sight yes hes gone my son and you must come in and eat your dinner with us and then well hitch up and take you down to nicholss oh i cant make you so much trouble i couldnt think of it ill walk i dont mind the distance but we wont let you walkit wouldnt be southern hospitality to do it come right in oh do says aunt sally it aint a bit of trouble to us not a bit in the world you must stay its a long dusty three mile and we cant let you walk and besides ive already told em to put on another plate when i see you coming so you mustnt disappoint us come right in and make yourself at home so tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome and let himself be persuaded and come in and when he was in he said he was a stranger from hicksville ohio and his name was william thompsonand he made another bow well he run on and on and on making up stuff about hicksville and everybody in it he could invent and i getting a little nervious and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape and at last still talking along he reached over and kissed aunt sally right on the mouth and then settled back again in his chair comfortable and was going on talking but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand and says you owdacious puppy he looked kind of hurt and says im surprised at you mam youre srpwhy what do you reckon i am ive a good notion to take andsay what do you mean by kissing me he looked kind of humble and says i didnt mean nothing mam i didnt mean no harm iithought youd like it why you born fool she took up the spinning stick and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it what made you think id like it well i dont know only theytheytold me you would they told you i would whoever told yous another lunatic i never heard the beat of it whos they why everybody they all said so mam it was all she could do to hold in and her eyes snapped and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him and she says whos everybody out with their names or therll be an idiot short he got up and looked distressed and fumbled his hat and says im sorry and i warnt expecting it they told me to they all told me to they all said kiss her and said shed like it they all said itevery one of them but im sorry mam and i wont do it no more i wont honest you wont wont you well i shd reckon you wont nom im honest about it i wont ever do it againtill you ask me till i ask you well i never see the beat of it in my born days i lay youll be the methusalemnumskull of creation before ever i ask you or the likes of you well he says it does surprise me so i cant make it out somehow they said you would and i thought you would but he stopped and looked around slow like he wished he could run across a friendly eye somewheres and fetched up on the old gentlemans and says didnt you think shed like me to kiss her sir why no iiwell no i blieve i didnt then he looks on around the same way to me and says tom didnt you think aunt sally d open out her arms and say sid sawyer my land she says breaking in and jumping for him you impudent young rascal to fool a body so and was going to hug him but he fended her off and says no not till youve asked me first so she didnt lose no time but asked him and hugged him and kissed him over and over again and then turned him over to the old man and he took what was left and after they got a little quiet again she says why dear me i never see such a surprise we warnt looking for you at all but only tom sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him its because it warnt intended for any of us to come but tom he says but i begged and begged and at the last minute she let me come too so coming down the river me and tom thought it would be a firstrate surprise for him to come here to the house first and for me to by and by tag along and drop in and let on to be a stranger but it was a mistake aunt sally this aint no healthy place for a stranger to come nonot impudent whelps sid you ought to had your jaws boxed i haint been so put out since i dont know when but i dont care i dont mind the termsid be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here well to think of that performance i dont deny it i was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack we had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen and there was things enough on that table for seven families and all hot too none of your flabby tough meat thats laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning uncle silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it but it was worth it and it didnt cool it a bit neither the way ive seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times there was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon and me and tom was on the lookout all the time but it warnt no use they didnt happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger and we was afraid to try to work up to it but at supper at night one of the little boys says pa maynt tom and sid and me go to the show no says the old man i reckon there aint going to be any and you couldnt go if there was because the runaway nigger told burton and me all about that scandalous show and burton said he would tell the people so i reckon theyve drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time so there it wasbut i couldnt help it tom and me was to sleep in the same room and bed so being tired we bid goodnight and went up to bed right after supper and clumb out of the window and down the lightningrod and shoved for the town for i didnt believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint and so if i didnt hurry up and give them one theyd get into trouble sure on the road tom he told me all about how it was reckoned i was murdered and how pap disappeared pretty soon and didnt come back no more and what a stir there was when jim run away and i told tom all about our royal nonesuch rapscallions and as much of the raft voyage as i had time to and as we struck into the town and up through the middle of itit was as much as halfafter eight thenhere comes a raging rush of people with torches and an awful whooping and yelling and banging tin pans and blowing horns and we jumped to one side to let them go by and as they went by i see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a railthat is i knowed it was the king and the duke though they was all over tar and feathers and didnt look like nothing in the world that was humanjust looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier plumes well it made me sick to see it and i was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals it seemed like i couldnt ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world it was a dreadful thing to see human beings can be awful cruel to one another we see we was too latecouldnt do no good we asked some stragglers about it and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage then somebody give a signal and the house rose up and went for them so we poked along back home and i warnt feeling so brash as i was before but kind of ornery and humble and to blame somehowthough i hadnt done nothing but thats always the way it dont make no difference whether you do right or wrong a persons conscience aint got no sense and just goes for him anyway if i had a yaller dog that didnt know no more than a persons conscience does i would pison him it takes up more room than all the rest of a persons insides and yet aint no good nohow tom sawyer he says the same chapter xxxiv we stopped talking and got to thinking by and by tom says looky here huck what fools we are to not think of it before i bet i know where jim is no where in that hut down by the ashhopper why looky here when we was at dinner didnt you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles yes what did you think the vittles was for for a dog so d i well it wasnt for a dog why because part of it was watermelon so it wasi noticed it well it does beat all that i never thought about a dog not eating watermelon it shows how a body can see and dont see at the same time well the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in and he locked it again when he came out he fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from tablesame key i bet watermelon shows man lock shows prisoner and it aint likely theres two prisoners on such a little plantation and where the peoples all so kind and good jims the prisoner all rightim glad we found it out detective fashion i wouldnt give shucks for any other way now you work your mind and study out a plan to steal jim and i will study out one too and well take the one we like the best what a head for just a boy to have if i had tom sawyers head i wouldnt trade it off to be a duke nor mate of a steamboat nor clown in a circus nor nothing i can think of i went to thinking out a plan but only just to be doing something i knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from pretty soon tom says ready yes i says all rightbring it out my plan is this i says we can easy find out if its jim in there then get up my canoe tomorrow night and fetch my raft over from the island then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old mans britches after he goes to bed and shove off down the river on the raft with jim hiding daytimes and running nights the way me and jim used to do before wouldnt that plan work work why certnly it would work like rats afighting but its too blame simple there aint nothing to it whats the good of a plan that aint no more trouble than that its as mild as goosemilk why huck it wouldnt make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory i never said nothing because i warnt expecting nothing different but i knowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it wouldnt have none of them objections to it and it didnt he told me what it was and i see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style and would make jim just as free a man as mine would and maybe get us all killed besides so i was satisfied and said we would waltz in on it i neednt tell what it was here because i knowed it wouldnt stay the way it was i knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance and that is what he done well one thing was dead sure and that was that tom sawyer was in earnest and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery that was the thing that was too many for me here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up and had a character to lose and folks at home that had characters and he was bright and not leatherheaded and knowing and not ignorant and not mean but kind and yet here he was without any more pride or rightness or feeling than to stoop to this business and make himself a shame and his family a shame before everybody i couldnt understand it no way at all it was outrageous and i knowed i ought to just up and tell him so and so be his true friend and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself and i did start to tell him but he shut me up and says dont you reckon i know what im about dont i generly know what im about yes didnt i say i was going to help steal the nigger yes well then thats all he said and thats all i said it warnt no use to say any more because when he said hed do a thing he always done it but i couldnt make out how he was willing to go into this thing so i just let it go and never bothered no more about it if he was bound to have it so i couldnt help it when we got home the house was all dark and still so we went on down to the hut by the ashhopper for to examine it we went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do they knowed us and didnt make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night when we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides and on the side i warnt acquainted withwhich was the north sidewe found a square windowhole up tolerable high with just one stout board nailed across it i says heres the ticket this holes big enough for jim to get through if we wrench off the board tom says its as simple as tittattoe threeinarow and as easy as playing hooky i should hope we can find a way thats a little more complicated than that huck finn well then i says how ll it do to saw him out the way i done before i was murdered that time thats more like he says its real mysterious and troublesome and good he says but i bet we can find a way thats twice as long there aint no hurry les keep on looking around betwixt the hut and the fence on the back side was a leanto that joined the hut at the eaves and was made out of plank it was as long as the hut but narrowonly about six foot wide the door to it was at the south end and was padlocked tom he went to the soapkettle and searched around and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with so he took it and prized out one of the staples the chain fell down and we opened the door and went in and shut it and struck a match and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadnt no connection with it and there warnt no floor to the shed nor nothing in it but some old rusty playedout hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow the match went out and so did we and shoved in the staple again and the door was locked as good as ever tom was joyful he says now were all right well dig him out it ll take about a week then we started for the house and i went in the back dooryou only have to pull a buckskin latchstring they dont fasten the doorsbut that warnt romantical enough for tom sawyer no way would do him but he must climb up the lightningrod but after he got up half way about three times and missed fire and fell every time and the last time most busted his brains out he thought hed got to give it up but after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck and this time he made the trip in the morning we was up at break of day and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed jimif it was jim that was being fed the niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields and jims nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things and whilst the others was leaving the key come from the house this nigger had a goodnatured chuckleheaded face and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread that was to keep witches off he said the witches was pestering him awful these nights and making him see all kinds of strange things and hear all kinds of strange words and noises and he didnt believe he was ever witched so long before in his life he got so worked up and got to running on so about his troubles he forgot all about what hed been agoing to do so tom says whats the vittles for going to feed the dogs the nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face like when you heave a brickbat in a mudpuddle and he says yes mars sid a dog curus dog too does you want to go en look at im yes i hunched tom and whispers you going right here in the daybreak that warnt the plan no it warnt but its the plan now so drat him we went along but i didnt like it much when we got in we couldnt hardly see anything it was so dark but jim was there sure enough and could see us and he sings out why huck en good lan ain dat misto tom i just knowed how it would be i just expected it i didnt know nothing to do and if i had i couldnt a done it because that nigger busted in and says why de gracious sakes do he know you genlmen we could see pretty well now tom he looked at the nigger steady and kind of wondering and says does who know us why disyer runaway nigger i dont reckon he does but what put that into your head what put it dar didn he jis dis minute sing out like he knowed you tom says in a puzzledup kind of way well thats mighty curious who sung out when did he sing out what did he sing out and turns to me perfectly cam and says did you hear anybody sing out of course there warnt nothing to be said but the one thing so i says no i aint heard nobody say nothing then he turns to jim and looks him over like he never see him before and says did you sing out no sah says jim i haint said nothing sah not a word no sah i haint said a word did you ever see us before no sah not as i knows on so tom turns to the nigger which was looking wild and distressed and says kind of severe what do you reckons the matter with you anyway what made you think somebody sung out oh its de dadblame witches sah en i wisht i was dead i do deys awluz at it sah en dey do mos kill me dey skyers me so please to dont tell nobody bout it sah er ole mars silas hell scole me kase he say dey aint no witches i jis wish to goodness he was heah now den what would he say i jis bet he couldn fine no way to git aroun it dis time but its awluz jis so people dats sot stays sot dey wont look into nothnen fine it out fr deyselves en when you fine it out en tell um bout it dey doan blieve you tom give him a dime and said we wouldnt tell nobody and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with and then looks at jim and says i wonder if uncle silas is going to hang this nigger if i was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away i wouldnt give him up id hang him and whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good he whispers to jim and says dont ever let on to know us and if you hear any digging going on nights its us were going to set you free jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it then the nigger come back and we said wed come again some time if the nigger wanted us to and he said he would more particular if it was dark because the witches went for him mostly in the dark and it was good to have folks around then chapter xxxv it would be most an hour yet till breakfast so we left and struck down into the woods because tom said we got to have some light to see how to dig by and a lantern makes too much and might get us into trouble what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks thats called foxfire and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place we fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds and set down to rest and tom says kind of dissatisfied blame it this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be and so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan there aint no watchman to be druggednow there ought to be a watchman there aint even a dog to give a sleepingmixture to and theres jim chained by one leg with a tenfoot chain to the leg of his bed why all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain and uncle silas he trusts everybody sends the key to the punkinheaded nigger and dont send nobody to watch the nigger jim could a got out of that windowhole before this only there wouldnt be no use trying to travel with a tenfoot chain on his leg why drat it huck its the stupidest arrangement i ever see you got to invent all the difficulties well we cant help it we got to do the best we can with the materials weve got anyhow theres one thingtheres more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers where there warnt one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them and you had to contrive them all out of your own head now look at just that one thing of the lantern when you come down to the cold facts we simply got to let on that a lanterns resky why we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to i believe now whilst i think of it we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get what do we want of a saw what do we want of it haint we got to saw the leg of jims bed off so as to get the chain loose why you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off well if that aint just like you huck finn you can get up the infantschooliest ways of going at a thing why haint you ever read any books at allbaron trenck nor casanova nor benvenuto chelleeny nor henri iv nor none of them heroes who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an oldmaidy way as that no the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bedleg in two and leave it just so and swallow the sawdust so it cant be found and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal cant see no sign of its being sawed and thinks the bedleg is perfectly sound then the night youre ready fetch the leg a kick down she goes slip off your chain and there you are nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements shin down it break your leg in the moat because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short you knowand theres your horses and your trusty vassles and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle and away you go to your native langudoc or navarre or wherever it is its gaudy huck i wish there was a moat to this cabin if we get time the night of the escape well dig one i says what do we want of a moat when were going to snake him out from under the cabin but he never heard me he had forgot me and everything else he had his chin in his hand thinking pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head then sighs again and says no it wouldnt dothere aint necessity enough for it for what i says why to saw jims leg off he says good land i says why there aint no necessity for it and what would you want to saw his leg off for anyway well some of the best authorities has done it they couldnt get the chain off so they just cut their hand off and shoved and a leg would be better still but we got to let that go there aint necessity enough in this case and besides jims a nigger and wouldnt understand the reasons for it and how its the custom in europe so well let it go but theres one thinghe can have a rope ladder we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough and we can send it to him in a pie its mostly done that way and ive et worse pies why tom sawyer how you talk i says jim aint got no use for a rope ladder he has got use for it how you talk you better say you dont know nothing about it hes got to have a rope ladder they all do what in the nation can he do with it do with it he can hide it in his bed cant he thats what they all do and hes got to too huck you dont ever seem to want to do anything thats regular you want to be starting something fresh all the time spose he dont do nothing with it aint it there in his bed for a clew after hes gone and dont you reckon theyll want clews of course they will and you wouldnt leave them any that would be a pretty howdydo wouldnt it i never heard of such a thing well i says if its in the regulations and hes got to have it all right let him have it because i dont wish to go back on no regulations but theres one thing tom sawyerif we go to tearing up our sheets to make jim a rope ladder were going to get into trouble with aunt sally just as sure as youre born now the way i look at it a hickrybark ladder dont cost nothing and dont waste nothing and is just as good to load up a pie with and hide in a straw tick as any rag ladder you can start and as for jim he aint had no experience and so he dont care what kind of a oh shucks huck finn if i was as ignorant as you id keep still thats what id do who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickrybark ladder why its perfectly ridiculous well all right tom fix it your own way but if youll take my advice youll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline he said that would do and that gave him another idea and he says borrow a shirt too what do we want of a shirt tom want it for jim to keep a journal on journal your grannyjim cant write spose he cant writehe can make marks on the shirt cant he if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrelhoop why tom we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one and quicker too prisoners dont have geese running around the donjonkeep to pull pens out of you muggins they always make their pens out of the hardest toughest troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out too because theyve got to do it by rubbing it on the wall they wouldnt use a goosequill if they had it it aint regular well then whatll we make him the ink out of many makes it out of ironrust and tears but thats the common sort and women the best authorities uses their own blood jim can do that and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where hes captivated he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window the iron mask always done that and its a blame good way too jim aint got no tin plates they feed him in a pan that aint nothing we can get him some cant nobody read his plates that aint got anything to do with it huck finn all hes got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out you dont have to be able to read it why half the time you cant read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate or anywhere else well then whats the sense in wasting the plates why blame it all it aint the prisoners plates but its somebodys plates aint it well sposn it is what does the prisoner care whose he broke off there because we heard the breakfasthorn blowing so we cleared out for the house along during the morning i borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothesline and i found an old sack and put them in it and we went down and got the foxfire and put that in too i called it borrowing because that was what pap always called it but tom said it warnt borrowing it was stealing he said we was representing prisoners and prisoners dont care how they get a thing so they get it and nobody dont blame them for it either it aint no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with tom said its his right and so as long as we was representing a prisoner we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with he said if we warnt prisoners it would be a very different thing and nobody but a mean ornery person would steal when he warnt a prisoner so we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy and yet he made a mighty fuss one day after that when i stole a watermelon out of the niggerpatch and eat it and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for tom said that what he meant was we could steal anything we needed well i says i needed the watermelon but he said i didnt need it to get out of prison with theres where the difference was he said if id a wanted it to hide a knife in and smuggle it to jim to kill the seneskal with it would a been all right so i let it go at that though i couldnt see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if i got to set down and chaw over a lot of goldleaf distinctions like that every time i see a chance to hog a watermelon well as i was saying we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business and nobody in sight around the yard then tom he carried the sack into the leanto whilst i stood off a piece to keep watch by and by he come out and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk he says everythings all right now except tools and thats easy fixed tools i says yes tools for what why to dig with we aint agoing to gnaw him out are we aint them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with i says he turns on me looking pitying enough to make a body cry and says huck finn did you ever hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with now i want to ask youif you got any reasonableness in you at allwhat kind of a show would that give him to be a hero why they might as well lend him the key and done with it picks and shovelswhy they wouldnt furnish em to a king well then i says if we dont want the picks and shovels what do we want a couple of caseknives to dig the foundations out from under that cabin with yes confound it its foolish tom it dont make no difference how foolish it is its the right wayand its the regular way and there aint no other way that ever i heard of and ive read all the books that gives any information about these things they always dig out with a caseknifeand not through dirt mind you generly its through solid rock and it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks and for ever and ever why look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the castle deef in the harbor of marseilles that dug himself out that way how long was he at it you reckon i dont know well guess i dont know a month and a half thirtyseven yearand he come out in china thats the kind i wish the bottom of this fortress was solid rock jim dont know nobody in china whats that got to do with it neither did that other fellow but youre always awandering off on a side issue why cant you stick to the main point all righti dont care where he comes out so he comes out and jim dont either i reckon but theres one thing anywayjims too old to be dug out with a caseknife he wont last yes he will last too you dont reckon its going to take thirtyseven years to dig out through a dirt foundation do you how long will it take tom well we cant resk being as long as we ought to because it maynt take very long for uncle silas to hear from down there by new orleans hell hear jim aint from there then his next move will be to advertise jim or something like that so we cant resk being as long digging him out as we ought to by rights i reckon we ought to be a couple of years but we cant things being so uncertain what i recommend is this that we really dig right in as quick as we can and after that we can let on to ourselves that we was at it thirtyseven years then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time theres an alarm yes i reckon that ll be the best way now theres sense in that i says letting on dont cost nothing letting on aint no trouble and if its any object i dont mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year it wouldnt strain me none after i got my hand in so ill mosey along now and smouch a couple of caseknives smouch three he says we want one to make a saw out of tom if it aint unregular and irreligious to sejest it i says theres an old rusty sawblade around yonder sticking under the weatherboarding behind the smokehouse he looked kind of weary and discouragedlike and says it aint no use to try to learn you nothing huck run along and smouch the knivesthree of them so i done it chapter xxxvi as soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightningrod and shut ourselves up in the leanto and got out our pile of foxfire and went to work we cleared everything out of the way about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log tom said he was right behind jims bed now and wed dig in under it and when we got through there couldnt nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there because jims counterpin hung down most to the ground and youd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole so we dug and dug with the caseknives till most midnight and then we was dogtired and our hands was blistered and yet you couldnt see wed done anything hardly at last i says this aint no thirtyseven year job this is a thirtyeight year job tom sawyer he never said nothing but he sighed and pretty soon he stopped digging and then for a good little while i knowed that he was thinking then he says it aint no use huck it aint agoing to work if we was prisoners it would because then wed have as many years as we wanted and no hurry and we wouldnt get but a few minutes to dig every day while they was changing watches and so our hands wouldnt get blistered and we could keep it up right along year in and year out and do it right and the way it ought to be done but we cant fool along we got to rush we aint got no time to spare if we was to put in another night this way wed have to knock off for a week to let our hands get wellcouldnt touch a caseknife with them sooner well then what we going to do tom ill tell you it aint right and it aint moral and i wouldnt like it to get out but there aint only just the one way we got to dig him out with the picks and let on its caseknives now youre talking i says your head gets leveler and leveler all the time tom sawyer i says picks is the thing moral or no moral and as for me i dont care shucks for the morality of it nohow when i start in to steal a nigger or a watermelon or a sundayschool book i aint no ways particular how its done so its done what i want is my nigger or what i want is my watermelon or what i want is my sundayschool book and if a picks the handiest thing thats the thing im agoing to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that sundayschool book out with and i dont give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther well he says theres excuse for picks and lettingon in a case like this if it warnt so i wouldnt approve of it nor i wouldnt stand by and see the rules brokebecause right is right and wrong is wrong and a body aint got no business doing wrong when he aint ignorant and knows better it might answer for you to dig jim out with a pick without any letting on because you dont know no better but it wouldnt for me because i do know better gimme a caseknife he had his own by him but i handed him mine he flung it down and says gimme a caseknife i didnt know just what to dobut then i thought i scratched around amongst the old tools and got a pickaxe and give it to him and he took it and went to work and never said a word he was always just that particular full of principle so then i got a shovel and then we picked and shoveled turn about and made the fur fly we stuck to it about a half an hour which was as long as we could stand up but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it when i got up stairs i looked out at the window and see tom doing his level best with the lightningrod but he couldnt come it his hands was so sore at last he says it aint no use it cant be done what you reckon i better do cant you think of no way yes i says but i reckon it aint regular come up the stairs and let on its a lightningrod so he done it next day tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house for to make some pens for jim out of and six tallow candles and i hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance and stole three tin plates tom says it wasnt enough but i said nobody wouldnt ever see the plates that jim throwed out because theyd fall in the dogfennel and jimpson weeds under the windowholethen we could tote them back and he could use them over again so tom was satisfied then he says now the thing to study out is how to get the things to jim take them in through the hole i says when we get it done he only just looked scornful and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea and then he went to studying by and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways but there warnt no need to decide on any of them yet said wed got to post jim first that night we went down the lightningrod a little after ten and took one of the candles along and listened under the windowhole and heard jim snoring so we pitched it in and it didnt wake him then we whirled in with the pick and shovel and in about two hours and a half the job was done we crept in under jims bed and into the cabin and pawed around and found the candle and lit it and stood over jim awhile and found him looking hearty and healthy and then we woke him up gentle and gradual he was so glad to see us he most cried and called us honey and all the pet names he could think of and was for having us hunt up a coldchisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away and clearing out without losing any time but tom he showed him how unregular it would be and set down and told him all about our plans and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm and not to be the least afraid because we would see he got away sure so jim he said it was all right and we set there and talked over old times awhile and then tom asked a lot of questions and when jim told him uncle silas come in every day or two to pray with him and aunt sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat and both of them was kind as they could be tom says now i know how to fix it well send you some things by them i said dont do nothing of the kind its one of the most jackass ideas i ever struck but he never paid no attention to me went right on it was his way when hed got his plans set so he told jim how wed have to smuggle in the ropeladder pie and other large things by nat the nigger that fed him and he must be on the lookout and not be surprised and not let nat see him open them and we would put small things in uncles coatpockets and he must steal them out and we would tie things to aunts apronstrings or put them in her apronpocket if we got a chance and told him what they would be and what they was for and told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood and all that he told him everything jim he couldnt see no sense in the most of it but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him so he was satisfied and said he would do it all just as tom said jim had plenty corncob pipes and tobacco so we had a right down good sociable time then we crawled out through the hole and so home to bed with hands that looked like theyd been chawed tom was in high spirits he said it was the best fun he ever had in his life and the most intellectural and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave jim to our children to get out for he believed jim would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it he said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year and would be the best time on record and he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it in the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes and tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket then we went to the nigger cabins and while i got nats notice off tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a cornpone that was in jims pan and we went along with nat to see how it would work and it just worked noble when jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out and there warnt ever anything could a worked better tom said so himself jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that thats always getting into bread you know but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first and whilst we was astanding there in the dimmish light here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under jims bed and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them and there warnt hardly room in there to get your breath by jings we forgot to fasten that leanto door the nigger nat he only just hollered witches once and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs and begun to groan like he was dying tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of jims meat and the dogs went for it and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door and i knowed hed fixed the other door too then he went to work on the nigger coaxing him and petting him and asking him if hed been imagining he saw something again he raised up and blinked his eyes around and says mars sid youll say is a fool but if i didnt blieve i see most a million dogs er devils er somen i wisht i may die right heah in dese tracks i did mos sholy mars sid i felt umi felt um sah dey was all over me dad fetch it i jis wisht i could git my hans on one er dem witches jis wunstony jis wunstits all id ast but mosly i wisht deyd lemme lone i does tom says well i tell you what i think what makes them come here just at this runaway niggers breakfasttime its because theyre hungry thats the reason you make them a witch pie thats the thing for you to do but my lan mars sid hows i gwyne to make m a witch pie i doan know how to make it i haint ever hearn er sich a thing bfo well then ill have to make it myself will you do it honeywill you ill wusshup de groun und yo foot i will all right ill do it seeing its you and youve been good to us and showed us the runaway nigger but you got to be mighty careful when we come around you turn your back and then whatever weve put in the pan dont you let on you see it at all and dont you look when jim unloads the pansomething might happen i dont know what and above all dont you handle the witchthings hannel m mars sid what is you atalkin bout i wouldn lay de weight er my finger on um not fr ten hundd thousn billion dollars i wouldnt chapter xxxvii that was all fixed so then we went away and went to the rubbagepile in the back yard where they keep the old boots and rags and pieces of bottles and woreout tin things and all such truck and scratched around and found an old tin washpan and stopped up the holes as well as we could to bake the pie in and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast and found a couple of shinglenails that tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with and dropped one of them in aunt sallys apronpocket which was hanging on a chair and tother we stuck in the band of uncle silass hat which was on the bureau because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway niggers house this morning and then went to breakfast and tom dropped the pewter spoon in uncle silass coatpocket and aunt sally wasnt come yet so we had to wait a little while and when she come she was hot and red and cross and couldnt hardly wait for the blessing and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest childs head with her thimble with the other and says ive hunted high and ive hunted low and it does beat all what has become of your other shirt my heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things and a hard piece of corncrust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a cough and was shot across the table and took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a fishingworm and let a cry out of him the size of a warwhoop and tom he turned kinder blue around the gills and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that and i would a sold out for half price if there was a bidder but after that we was all right againit was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold uncle silas he says its most uncommon curious i cant understand it i know perfectly well i took it off because because you haint got but one on just listen at the man i know you took it off and know it by a better way than your woolgethering memory too because it was on the closline yesterdayi see it there myself but its gone thats the long and the short of it and youll just have to change to a red flannl one till i can get time to make a new one and it ll be the third ive made in two years it just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts and whatever you do manage to do with m all is moren i can make out a body d think you would learn to take some sort of care of em at your time of life i know it sally and i do try all i can but it oughtnt to be altogether my fault because you know i dont see them nor have nothing to do with them except when theyre on me and i dont believe ive ever lost one of them off of me well it aint your fault if you havent silas youd a done it if you could i reckon and the shirt aint all thats gone nuther thers a spoon gone and that aint all there was ten and now thers only nine the calf got the shirt i reckon but the calf never took the spoon thats certain why what else is gone sally thers six candles gonethats what the rats could a got the candles and i reckon they did i wonder they dont walk off with the whole place the way youre always going to stop their holes and dont do it and if they warnt fools theyd sleep in your hair silasyoud never find it out but you cant lay the spoon on the rats and that i know well sally im in fault and i acknowledge it ive been remiss but i wont let tomorrow go by without stopping up them holes oh i wouldnt hurry next year ll do matilda angelina araminta phelps whack comes the thimble and the child snatches her claws out of the sugarbowl without fooling around any just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage and says missus deys a sheet gone a sheet gone well for the lands sake ill stop up them holes today says uncle silas looking sorrowful oh do shet upspose the rats took the sheet wheres it gone lize clah to goodness i haint no notion miss sally she wuz on de closline yistiddy but she done gone she ain dah no mo now i reckon the world is coming to an end i never see the beat of it in all my born days a shirt and a sheet and a spoon and six can missus comes a young yaller wench deys a brass cannelstick missn cler out from here you hussy er ill take a skillet to ye well she was just abiling i begun to lay for a chance i reckoned i would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated she kept araging right along running her insurrection all by herself and everybody else mighty meek and quiet and at last uncle silas looking kind of foolish fishes up that spoon out of his pocket she stopped with her mouth open and her hands up and as for me i wished i was in jeruslem or somewheres but not long because she says its just as i expected so you had it in your pocket all the time and like as not youve got the other things there too howd it get there i reely dont know sally he says kind of apologizing or you know i would tell i was astudying over my text in acts seventeen before breakfast and i reckon i put it in there not noticing meaning to put my testament in and it must be so because my testament aint in but ill go and see and if the testament is where i had it ill know i didnt put it in and that will show that i laid the testament down and took up the spoon and oh for the lands sake give a body a rest go long now the whole kit and biling of ye and dont come nigh me again till ive got back my peace of mind id a heard her if shed a said it to herself let alone speaking it out and id a got up and obeyed her if id a been dead as we was passing through the settingroom the old man he took up his hat and the shinglenail fell out on the floor and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantelshelf and never said nothing and went out tom see him do it and remembered about the spoon and says well it aint no use to send things by him no more he aint reliable then he says but he done us a good turn with the spoon anyway without knowing it and so well go and do him one without him knowing itstop up his ratholes there was a noble good lot of them down cellar and it took us a whole hour but we done the job tight and good and shipshape then we heard steps on the stairs and blowed out our light and hid and here comes the old man with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in tother looking as absentminded as year before last he went a mooning around first to one rathole and then another till hed been to them all then he stood about five minutes picking tallowdrip off of his candle and thinking then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs saying well for the life of me i cant remember when i done it i could show her now that i warnt to blame on account of the rats but never mind let it go i reckon it wouldnt do no good and so he went on amumbling up stairs and then we left he was a mighty nice old man and always is tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon but he said wed got to have it so he took a think when he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do then we went and waited around the spoonbasket till we see aunt sally coming and then tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side and i slid one of them up my sleeve and tom says why aunt sally there aint but nine spoons yet she says go long to your play and dont bother me i know better i counted m myself well ive counted them twice aunty and i cant make but nine she looked out of all patience but of course she come to countanybody would i declare to gracious ther aint but nine she says why what in the worldplague take the things ill count m again so i slipped back the one i had and when she got done counting she says hang the troublesome rubbage thers ten now and she looked huffy and bothered both but tom says why aunty i dont think theres ten you numskull didnt you see me count m i know but well ill count m again so i smouched one and they come out nine same as the other time well she was in a tearing wayjust atrembling all over she was so mad but she counted and counted till she got that addled shed start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes and so three times they come out right and three times they come out wrong then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galleywest and she said cler out and let her have some peace and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner shed skin us so we had the odd spoon and dropped it in her apronpocket whilst she was agiving us our sailing orders and jim got it all right along with her shingle nail before noon we was very well satisfied with this business and tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took because he said now she couldnt ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life and wouldnt believe shed counted them right if she did and said that after shed about counted her head off for the next three days he judged shed give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more so we put the sheet back on the line that night and stole one out of her closet and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of days till she didnt know how many sheets she had any more and she didnt care and warnt agoing to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it and wouldnt count them again not to save her life she druther die first so we was all right now as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixedup counting and as to the candlestick it warnt no consequence it would blow over by and by but that pie was a job we had no end of trouble with that pie we fixed it up away down in the woods and cooked it there and we got it done at last and very satisfactory too but not all in one day and we had to use up three washpans full of flour before we got through and we got burnt pretty much all over in places and eyes put out with the smoke because you see we didnt want nothing but a crust and we couldnt prop it up right and she would always cave in but of course we thought of the right way at lastwhich was to cook the ladder too in the pie so then we laid in with jim the second night and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with we let on it took nine months to make it and in the forenoon we took it down to the woods but it wouldnt go into the pie being made of a whole sheet that way there was rope enough for forty pies if wed a wanted them and plenty left over for soup or sausage or anything you choose we could a had a whole dinner but we didnt need it all we needed was just enough for the pie and so we throwed the rest away we didnt cook none of the pies in the washpanafraid the solder would melt but uncle silas he had a noble brass warmingpan which he thought considerable of because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from england with william the conqueror in the mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable not on account of being any account because they warnt but on account of them being relicts you know and we snaked her out private and took her down there but she failed on the first pies because we didnt know how but she come up smiling on the last one we took and lined her with dough and set her in the coals and loaded her up with rag rope and put on a dough roof and shut down the lid and put hot embers on top and stood off five foot with the long handle cool and comfortable and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at but the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along for if that rope ladder wouldnt cramp him down to business i dont know nothing what im talking about and lay him in enough stomachache to last him till next time too nat didnt look when we put the witch pie in jims pan and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles and so jim got everything all right and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the windowhole chapter xxxviii making them pens was a distressid tough job and so was the saw and jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all thats the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall but he had to have it tom said hed got to there warnt no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind and his coat of arms look at lady jane grey he says look at gilford dudley look at old northumberland why huck spose it is considerble troublewhat you going to dohow you going to get around it jims got to do his inscription and coat of arms they all do jim says why mars tom i haint got no coat o arm i haint got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt en you knows i got to keep de journal on dat oh you dont understand jim a coat of arms is very different well i says jims right anyway when he says he aint got no coat of arms because he haint i reckon i knowed that tom says but you bet hell have one before he goes out of thisbecause hes going out right and there aint going to be no flaws in his record so whilst me and jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece jim amaking hisn out of the brass and i making mine out of the spoon tom set to work to think out the coat of arms by and by he said hed struck so many good ones he didnt hardly know which to take but there was one which he reckoned hed decide on he says on the scutcheon well have a bend or in the dexter base a saltire murrey in the fess with a dog couchant for common charge and under his foot a chain embattled for slavery with a chevron vert in a chief engrailed and three invected lines on a field azure with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented crest a runaway nigger sable with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister and a couple of gules for supporters which is you and me motto maggiore fretta minore otto got it out of a bookmeans the more haste the less speed geewhillikins i says but what does the rest of it mean we aint got no time to bother over that he says we got to dig in like all gitout well anyway i says whats some of it whats a fess a fessa fess isyou dont need to know what a fess is ill show him how to make it when he gets to it shucks tom i says i think you might tell a person whats a bar sinister oh i dont know but hes got to have it all the nobility does that was just his way if it didnt suit him to explain a thing to you he wouldnt do it you might pump at him a week it wouldnt make no difference hed got all that coat of arms business fixed so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work which was to plan out a mournful inscriptionsaid jim got to have one like they all done he made up a lot and wrote them out on a paper and read them off so here a captive heart busted here a poor prisoner forsook by the world and friends fretted his sorrowful life here a lonely heart broke and a worn spirit went to its rest after thirtyseven years of solitary captivity here homeless and friendless after thirtyseven years of bitter captivity perished a noble stranger natural son of louis xiv toms voice trembled whilst he was reading them and he most broke down when he got done he couldnt no way make up his mind which one for jim to scrabble on to the wall they was all so good but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail and he didnt know how to make letters besides but tom said he would block them out for him and then he wouldnt have nothing to do but just follow the lines then pretty soon he says come to think the logs aint agoing to do they dont have log walls in a dungeon we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock well fetch a rock jim said the rock was worse than the logs he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldnt ever get out but tom said he would let me help him do it then he took a look to see how me and jim was getting along with the pens it was most pesky tedious hard work and slow and didnt give my hands no show to get well of the sores and we didnt seem to make no headway hardly so tom says i know how to fix it we got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions and we can kill two birds with that same rock theres a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill and well smouch it and carve the things on it and file out the pens and the saw on it too it warnt no slouch of an idea and it warnt no slouch of a grindstone nuther but we allowed wed tackle it it warnt quite midnight yet so we cleared out for the mill leaving jim at work we smouched the grindstone and set out to roll her home but it was a most nation tough job sometimes do what we could we couldnt keep her from falling over and she come mighty near mashing us every time tom said she was going to get one of us sure before we got through we got her half way and then we was plumb played out and most drownded with sweat we see it warnt no use we got to go and fetch jim so he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bedleg and wrapt it round and round his neck and we crawled out through our hole and down there and jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing and tom superintended he could outsuperintend any boy i ever see he knowed how to do everything our hole was pretty big but it warnt big enough to get the grindstone through but jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough then tom marked out them things on it with the nail and set jim to work on them with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the leanto for a hammer and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him and then he could go to bed and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it then we helped him fix his chain back on the bedleg and was ready for bed ourselves but tom thought of something and says you got any spiders in here jim no sah thanks to goodness i haint mars tom all right well get you some but bless you honey i doan want none is afeard un um i jis s soon have rattlesnakes aroun tom thought a minute or two and says its a good idea and i reckon its been done it must a been done it stands to reason yes its a prime good idea where could you keep it keep what

you got to do it with tears shell die on my hans mars tom she sholy will kase i doan skasely ever cry so tom was stumped but he studied it over and then said jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion he promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one private in jims coffeepot in the morning jim said he would jis s soon have tobacker in his coffee and found so much fault with it and with the work and bother of raising the mullen and jewsharping the rats and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things on top of all the other work he had to do on pens and inscriptions and journals and things which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook that tom most lost all patience with him and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself and yet he didnt know enough to appreciate them and they was just about wasted on him so jim he was sorry and said he wouldnt behave so no more and then me and tom shoved for bed chapter xxxix in the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rattrap and fetched it down and unstopped the best rathole and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones and then we took it and put it in a safe place under aunt sallys bed but while we was gone for spiders little thomas franklin benjamin jefferson elexander phelps found it there and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out and they did and aunt sally she come in and when we got back she was astanding on top of the bed raising cain and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her so she took and dusted us both with the hickry and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen drat that meddlesome cub and they warnt the likeliest nuther because the first haul was the pick of the flock i never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was we got a splendid stock of sorted spiders and bugs and frogs and caterpillars and one thing or another and we like to got a hornets nest but we didnt the family was at home we didnt give it right up but stayed with them as long as we could because we allowed wed tire them out or theyd got to tire us out and they done it then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places and was pretty near all right again but couldnt set down convenient and so we went for the snakes and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and housesnakes and put them in a bag and put it in our room and by that time it was suppertime and a rattling good honest days work and hungryoh no i reckon not and there warnt a blessed snake up there when we went backwe didnt half tie the sack and they worked out somehow and left but it didnt matter much because they was still on the premises somewheres so we judged we could get some of them again no there warnt no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell youd see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then and they generly landed in your plate or down the back of your neck and most of the time where you didnt want them well they was handsome and striped and there warnt no harm in a million of them but that never made no difference to aunt sally she despised snakes be the breed what they might and she couldnt stand them no way you could fix it and every time one of them flopped down on her it didnt make no difference what she was doing she would just lay that work down and light out i never see such a woman and you could hear her whoop to jericho you couldnt get her to take aholt of one of them with the tongs and if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire she disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadnt ever been no snakes created why after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week aunt sally warnt over it yet she warnt near over it when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings it was very curious but tom said all women was just so he said they was made that way for some reason or other we got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way and she allowed these lickings warnt nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them i didnt mind the lickings because they didnt amount to nothing but i minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot but we got them laid in and all the other things and you never see a cabin as blithesome as jims was when theyd all swarm out for music and go for him jim didnt like the spiders and the spiders didnt like jim and so theyd lay for him and make it mighty warm for him and he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warnt no room in bed for him skasely and when there was a body couldnt sleep it was so lively and it was always lively he said because they never all slept at one time but took turn about so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch so he always had one gang under him in his way and tother gang having a circus over him and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over he said if he ever got out this time he wouldnt ever be a prisoner again not for a salary well by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape the shirt was sent in early in a pie and every time a rat bit jim he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh the pens was made the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone the bedleg was sawed in two and we had et up the sawdust and it give us a most amazing stomachache we reckoned we was all going to die but didnt it was the most undigestible sawdust i ever see and tom said the same but as i was saying wed got all the work done now at last and we was all pretty much fagged out too but mainly jim the old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below orleans to come and get their runaway nigger but hadnt got no answer because there warnt no such plantation so he allowed he would advertise jim in the st louis and new orleans papers and when he mentioned the st louis ones it give me the cold shivers and i see we hadnt no time to lose so tom said now for the nonnamous letters whats them i says warnings to the people that something is up sometimes its done one way sometimes another but theres always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle when louis xvi was going to light out of the tooleries a servantgirl done it its a very good way and so is the nonnamous letters well use them both and its usual for the prisoners mother to change clothes with him and she stays in and he slides out in her clothes well do that too but looky here tom what do we want to warn anybody for that somethings up let them find it out for themselvesits their lookout yes i know but you cant depend on them its the way theyve acted from the very startleft us to do everything theyre so confiding and mulletheaded they dont take notice of nothing at all so if we dont give them notice there wont be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape ll go off perfectly flat wont amount to nothingwont be nothing to it well as for me tom thats the way id like shucks he says and looked disgusted so i says but i aint going to make no complaint any way that suits you suits me what you going to do about the servantgirl youll be her you slide in in the middle of the night and hook that yaller girls frock why tom that ll make trouble next morning because of course she probbly haint got any but that one i know but you dont want it but fifteen minutes to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door all right then ill do it but i could carry it just as handy in my own togs you wouldnt look like a servantgirl then would you no but there wont be nobody to see what i look like anyway that aint got nothing to do with it the thing for us to do is just to do our duty and not worry about whether anybody sees us do it or not haint you got no principle at all all right i aint saying nothing im the servantgirl whos jims mother im his mother ill hook a gown from aunt sally well then youll have to stay in the cabin when me and jim leaves not much ill stuff jims clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise and jim ll take the nigger womans gown off of me and wear it and well all evade together when a prisoner of style escapes its called an evasion its always called so when a king escapes frinstance and the same with a kings son it dont make no difference whether hes a natural one or an unnatural one so tom he wrote the nonnamous letter and i smouched the yaller wenchs frock that night and put it on and shoved it under the front door the way tom told me to it said beware trouble is brewing keep a sharp lookout unknown friend next night we stuck a picture which tom drawed in blood of a skull and crossbones on the front door and next night another one of a coffin on the back door i never see a family in such a sweat they couldnt a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air if a door banged aunt sally she jumped and said ouch if anything fell she jumped and said ouch if you happened to touch her when she warnt noticing she done the same she couldnt face noway and be satisfied because she allowed there was something behind her every timeso she was always awhirling around sudden and saying ouch and before shed got twothirds around shed whirl back again and say it again and she was afraid to go to bed but she dasnt set up so the thing was working very well tom said he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory he said it showed it was done right so he said now for the grand bulge so the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready and was wondering what we better do with it because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night tom he went down the lightningrod to spy around and the nigger at the back door was asleep and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back this letter said dont betray me i wish to be your friend there is a desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the indian territory going to steal your runaway nigger tonight and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them i am one of the gang but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again and will betray the helish design they will sneak down from northards along the fence at midnight exact with a false key and go in the niggers cabin to get him i am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if i see any danger but stead of that i will ba like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all then whilst they are getting his chains loose you slip there and lock them in and can kill them at your leasure dont do anything but just the way i am telling you if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoopjamboreehoo i do not wish any reward but to know i have done the right thing unknown friend chapter xl we was feeling pretty good after breakfast and took my canoe and went over the river afishing with a lunch and had a good time and took a look at the raft and found her all right and got home late to supper and found them in such a sweat and worry they didnt know which end they was standing on and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper and wouldnt tell us what the trouble was and never let on a word about the new letter but didnt need to because we knowed as much about it as anybody did and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed and got up about halfpast eleven and tom put on aunt sallys dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch but says wheres the butter i laid out a hunk of it i says on a piece of a cornpone well you left it laid out thenit aint here we can get along without it i says we can get along with it too he says just you slide down cellar and fetch it and then mosey right down the lightningrod and come along ill go and stuff the straw into jims clothes to represent his mother in disguise and be ready to ba like a sheep and shove soon as you get there so out he went and down cellar went i the hunk of butter big as a persons fist was where i had left it so i took up the slab of cornpone with it on and blowed out my light and started up stairs very stealthy and got up to the main floor all right but here comes aunt sally with a candle and i clapped the truck in my hat and clapped my hat on my head and the next second she see me and she says you been down cellar yesm what you been doing down there nothn nothn nom well then what possessed you to go down there this time of night i dont know m you dont know dont answer me that way tom i want to know what you been doing down there i haint been doing a single thing aunt sally i hope to gracious if i have i reckoned shed let me go now and as a generl thing she would but i spose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that warnt yardstick straight so she says very decided you just march into that settingroom and stay there till i come you been up to something you no business to and i lay ill find out what it is before im done with you so she went away as i opened the door and walked into the settingroom my but there was a crowd there fifteen farmers and every one of them had a gun i was most powerful sick and slunk to a chair and set down they was setting around some of them talking a little in a low voice and all of them fidgety and uneasy but trying to look like they warnt but i knowed they was because they was always taking off their hats and putting them on and scratching their heads and changing their seats and fumbling with their buttons i warnt easy myself but i didnt take my hat off all the same i did wish aunt sally would come and get done with me and lick me if she wanted to and let me get away and tell tom how wed overdone this thing and what a thundering hornetsnest wed got ourselves into so we could stop fooling around straight off and clear out with jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us at last she come and begun to ask me questions but i couldnt answer them straight i didnt know which end of me was up because these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right now and lay for them desperadoes and saying it warnt but a few minutes to midnight and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheepsignal and here was aunty pegging away at the questions and me ashaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks i was that scared and the place getting hotter and hotter and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears and pretty soon when one of them says im for going and getting in the cabin first and right now and catching them when they come i most dropped and a streak of butter come atrickling down my forehead and aunt sally she see it and turns white as a sheet and says for the lands sake what is the matter with the child hes got the brainfever as shore as youre born and theyre oozing out and everybody runs to see and she snatches off my hat and out comes the bread and what was left of the butter and she grabbed me and hugged me and says oh what a turn you did give me and how glad and grateful i am it aint no worse for lucks against us and it never rains but it pours and when i see that truck i thought wed lost you for i knowed by the color and all it was just like your brains would be ifdear dear whydnt you tell me that was what youd been down there for i wouldnt a cared now cler out to bed and dont lemme see no more of you till morning i was up stairs in a second and down the lightningrod in another one and shinning through the dark for the leanto i couldnt hardly get my words out i was so anxious but i told tom as quick as i could we must jump for it now and not a minute to losethe house full of men yonder with guns his eyes just blazed and he says nois that so aint it bully why huck if it was to do over again i bet i could fetch two hundred if we could put it off till hurry hurry i says wheres jim right at your elbow if you reach out your arm you can touch him hes dressed and everythings ready now well slide out and give the sheepsignal but then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door and heard them begin to fumble with the padlock and heard a man say i told you wed be too soon they havent comethe door is locked here ill lock some of you into the cabin and you lay for em in the dark and kill em when they come and the rest scatter around a piece and listen if you can hear em coming so in they come but couldnt see us in the dark and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed but we got under all right and out through the hole swift but softjim first me next and tom last which was according to toms orders now we was in the leanto and heard trampings close by outside so we crept to the door and tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack but couldnt make out nothing it was so dark and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further and when he nudged us jim must glide out first and him last so he set his ear to the crack and listened and listened and listened and the steps ascraping around out there all the time and at last he nudged us and we slid out and stooped down not breathing and not making the least noise and slipped stealthy towards the fence in injun file and got to it all right and me and jim over it but toms britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail and then he hear the steps coming so he had to pull loose which snapped the splinter and made a noise and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out whos that answer or ill shoot but we didnt answer we just unfurled our heels and shoved then there was a rush and a bang bang bang and the bullets fairly whizzed around us we heard them sing out here they are theyve broke for the river after em boys and turn loose the dogs so here they come full tilt we could hear them because they wore boots and yelled but we didnt wear no boots and didnt yell we was in the path to the mill and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by and then dropped in behind them theyd had all the dogs shut up so they wouldnt scare off the robbers but by this time somebody had let them loose and here they come making powwow enough for a million but they was our dogs so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up and when they see it warnt nobody but us and no excitement to offer them they only just said howdy and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering and then we upsteam again and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river but didnt make no more noise than we was obleeged to then we struck out easy and comfortable for the island where my raft was and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out and when we stepped on to the raft i says now old jim youre a free man again and i bet you wont ever be a slave no more en a mighty good job it wuz too huck it uz planned beautiful en it uz done beautiful en dey aint nobody kin git up a plan dats mo mixedup en splendid den what dat one wuz we was all glad as we could be but tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg when me and jim heard that we didnt feel so brash as what we did before it was hurting him considerable and bleeding so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the dukes shirts for to bandage him but he says gimme the rags i can do it myself dont stop now dont fool around here and the evasion booming along so handsome man the sweeps and set her loose boys we done it elegantdeed we did i wish wed a had the handling of louis xvi there wouldnt a been no son of saint louis ascend to heaven wrote down in his biography no sir wed a whooped him over the borderthats what wed a done with himand done it just as slick as nothing at all too man the sweepsman the sweeps but me and jim was consultingand thinking and after wed thought a minute i says say it jim so he says well den dis is de way it look to me huck ef it wuz him dat uz bein sot free en one er de boys wuz to git shot would he say go on en save me nemmine bout a doctor fr to save dis one is dat like mars tom sawyer would he say dat you bet he wouldnt well den is jim gywne to say it no sahi doan budge a step outn dis place dout a doctor not if its forty year i knowed he was white inside and i reckoned hed say what he did sayso it was all right now and i told tom i was agoing for a doctor he raised considerable row about it but me and jim stuck to it and wouldnt budge so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself but we wouldnt let him then he give us a piece of his mind but it didnt do no good so when he sees me getting the canoe ready he says well then if youre bound to go ill tell you the way to do when you get to the village shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast and make him swear to be silent as the grave and put a purse full of gold in his hand and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark and then fetch him here in the canoe in a roundabout way amongst the islands and search him and take his chalk away from him and dont give it back to him till you get him back to the village or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again its the way they all do so i said i would and left and jim was to hide in the woods when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again chapter xli the doctor was an old man a very nice kindlooking old man when i got him up i told him me and my brother was over on spanish island hunting yesterday afternoon and camped on a piece of a raft we found and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams for it went off and shot him in the leg and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it nor let anybody know because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks who is your folks he says the phelpses down yonder oh he says and after a minute he says howd you say he got shot he had a dream i says and it shot him singular dream he says so he lit up his lantern and got his saddlebags and we started but when he sees the canoe he didnt like the look of hersaid she was big enough for one but didnt look pretty safe for two i says oh you neednt be afeard sir she carried the three of us easy enough what three why me and sid andandand the guns thats what i mean oh he says but he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her and shook his head and said he reckoned hed look around for a bigger one but they was all locked and chained so he took my canoe and said for me to wait till he come back or i could hunt around further or maybe i better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if i wanted to but i said i didnt so i told him just how to find the raft and then he started i struck an idea pretty soon i says to myself sposn he cant fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheeps tail as the saying is sposn it takes him three or four days what are we going to dolay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag no sir i know what ill do ill wait and when he comes back if he says hes got to go any more ill get down there too if i swim and well take and tie him and keep him and shove out down the river and when toms done with him well give him what its worth or all we got and then let him get ashore so then i crept into a lumberpile to get some sleep and next time i waked up the sun was away up over my head i shot out and went for the doctors house but they told me hed gone away in the night some time or other and warnt back yet well thinks i that looks powerful bad for tom and ill dig out for the island right off so away i shoved and turned the corner and nearly rammed my head into uncle silass stomach he says why tom where you been all this time you rascal i haint been nowheres i says only just hunting for the runaway niggerme and sid why where ever did you go he says your aunts been mighty uneasy she neednt i says because we was all right we followed the men and the dogs but they outrun us and we lost them but we thought we heard them on the water so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over but couldnt find nothing of them so we cruised along upshore till we got kind of tired and beat out and tied up the canoe and went to sleep and never waked up till about an hour ago then we paddled over here to hear the news and sids at the postoffice to see what he can hear and im abranching out to get something to eat for us and then were going home so then we went to the postoffice to get sid but just as i suspicioned he warnt there so the old man he got a letter out of the office and we waited awhile longer but sid didnt come so the old man said come along let sid foot it home or canoe it when he got done fooling aroundbut we would ride i couldnt get him to let me stay and wait for sid and he said there warnt no use in it and i must come along and let aunt sally see we was all right when we got home aunt sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both and hugged me and give me one of them lickings of hern that dont amount to shucks and said shed serve sid the same when he come and the place was plum full of farmers and farmers wives to dinner and

time midnight come last night i hope to gracious if i warnt afraid theyd steal some o the family i was just to that pass i didnt have no reasoning faculties no more it looks foolish enough now in the daytime but i says to myself theres my two poor boys asleep way up stairs in that lonesome room and i declare to goodness i was that uneasy t i crep up there and locked em in i did and anybody would because you know when you get scared that way and it keeps running on and getting worse and worse all the time and your wits gets to addling and you get to doing all sorts o wild things and by and by you think to yourself sposn i was a boy and was away up there and the door aint locked and you she stopped looking kind of wondering and then she turned her head around slow and when her eye lit on mei got up and took a walk says i to myself i can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if i go out to one side and study over it a little so i done it but i dasnt go fur or shed a sent for me and when it was late in the day the people all went and then i come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and sid and the door was locked and we wanted to see the fun so we went down the lightningrod and both of us got hurt a little and we didnt never want to try that no more and then i went on and told her all what i told uncle silas before and then she said shed forgive us and maybe it was all right enough anyway and about what a body might expect of boys for all boys was a pretty harumscarum lot as fur as she could see and so as long as no harm hadnt come of it she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still stead of fretting over what was past and done so then she kissed me and patted me on the head and dropped into a kind of a brown study and pretty soon jumps up and says why lawsamercy its most night and sid not come yet what has become of that boy i see my chance so i skips up and says ill run right up to town and get him i says no you wont she says youll stay right wher you are ones enough to be lost at a time if he aint here to supper your uncle ll go well he warnt there to supper so right after supper uncle went he come back about ten a little bit uneasy hadnt run across toms track aunt sally was a good deal uneasy but uncle silas he said there warnt no occasion to beboys will be boys he said and youll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right so she had to be satisfied but she said shed set up for him a while anyway and keep a light burning so he could see it and then when i went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle and tucked me in and mothered me so good i felt mean and like i couldnt look her in the face and she set down on the bed and talked with me a long time and said what a splendid boy sid was and didnt seem to want to ever stop talking about him and kept asking me every now and then if i reckoned he could a got lost or hurt or maybe drownded and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead and she not by him to help him and so the tears would drip down silent and i would tell her that sid was all right and would be home in the morning sure and she would squeeze my hand or maybe kiss me and tell me to say it again and keep on saying it because it done her good and she was in so much trouble and when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle and says the door aint going to be locked tom and theres the window and the rod but youll be good wont you and you wont go for my sake laws knows i wanted to go bad enough to see about tom and was all intending to go but after that i wouldnt a went not for kingdoms but she was on my mind and tom was on my mind so i slept very restless and twice i went down the rod away in the night and slipped around front and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes towards the road and the tears in them and i wished i could do something for her but i couldnt only to swear that i wouldnt never do nothing to grieve her any more and the third time i waked up at dawn and slid down and she was there yet and her candle was most out and her old gray head was resting on her hand and she was asleep chapter xlii the old man was uptown again before breakfast but couldnt get no track of tom and both of them set at the table thinking and not saying nothing and looking mournful and their coffee getting cold and not eating anything and by and by the old man says did i give you the letter what letter the one i got yesterday out of the postoffice no you didnt give me no letter well i must a forgot it so he rummaged his pockets and then went off somewheres where he had laid it down and fetched it and give it to her she says why its from st petersburgits from sis i allowed another walk would do me good but i couldnt stir but before she could break it open she dropped it and runfor she see something and so did i it was tom sawyer on a mattress and that old doctor and jim in her calico dress with his hands tied behind him and a lot of people i hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy and rushed she flung herself at tom crying and says oh hes dead hes dead i know hes dead and tom he turned his head a little and muttered something or other which showed he warnt in his right mind then she flung up her hands and says hes alive thank god and thats enough and she snatched a kiss of him and flew for the house to get the bed ready and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody else as fast as her tongue could go every jump of the way i followed the men to see what they was going to do with jim and the old doctor and uncle silas followed after tom into the house the men was very huffy and some of them wanted to hang jim for an example to all the other niggers around there so they wouldnt be trying to run away like jim done and making such a raft of trouble and keeping a whole family scared most to death for days and nights but the others said dont do it it wouldnt answer at all he aint our nigger and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him sure so that cooled them down a little because the people thats always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that haint done just right is always the very ones that aint the most anxious to pay for him when theyve got their satisfaction out of him they cussed jim considerble though and give him a cuff or two side the head once in a while but jim never said nothing and he never let on to know me and they took him to the same cabin and put his own clothes on him and chained him again and not to no bedleg this time but to a big staple drove into the bottom log and chained his hands too and both legs and said he warnt to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come or he was sold at auction because he didnt come in a certain length of time and filled up our hole and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl goodbye cussing and then the old doctor comes and takes a look and says dont be no rougher on him than youre obleeged to because he aint a bad nigger when i got to where i found the boy i see i couldnt cut the bullet out without some help and he warnt in no condition for me to leave to go and get help and he got a little worse and a little worse and after a long time he went out of his head and wouldnt let me come anigh him any more and said if i chalked his raft hed kill me and no end of wild foolishness like that and i see i couldnt do anything at all with him so i says i got to have help somehow and the minute i says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says hell help and he done it too and done it very well of course i judged he must be a runaway nigger and there i was and there i had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night it was a fix i tell you i had a couple of patients with the chills and of course id of liked to run up to town and see them but i dasnt because the nigger might get away and then id be to blame and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail so there i had to stick plumb until daylight this morning and i never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller and yet he was risking his freedom to do it and was all tired out too and i see plain enough hed been worked main hard lately i liked the nigger for that i tell you gentlemen a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollarsand kind treatment too i had everything i needed and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at homebetter maybe because it was so quiet but there i was with both of m on my hands and there i had to stick till about dawn this morning then some men in a skiff come by and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep so i motioned them in quiet and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about and we never had no trouble and the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep too we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on and towed her over very nice and quiet and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start he aint no bad nigger gentlemen thats what i think about him somebody says well it sounds very good doctor im obleeged to say then the others softened up a little too and i was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing jim that good turn and i was glad it was according to my judgment of him too because i thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time i see him then they all agreed that jim had acted very well and was deserving to have some notice took of it and reward so every one of them promised right out and hearty that they wouldnt cuss him no more then they come out and locked him up i hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off because they was rotten heavy or could have meat and greens with his bread and water but they didnt think of it and i reckoned it warnt best for me to mix in but i judged id get the doctors yarn to aunt sally somehow or other as soon as id got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me explanations i mean of how i forgot to mention about sid being shot when i was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger but i had plenty time aunt sally she stuck to the sickroom all day and all night and every time i see uncle silas mooning around i dodged him next morning i heard tom was a good deal better and they said aunt sally was gone to get a nap so i slips to the sickroom and if i found him awake i reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash but he was sleeping and sleeping very peaceful too and pale not firefaced the way he was when he come so i set down and laid for him to wake in about half an hour aunt sally comes gliding in and there i was up a stump again she motioned me to be still and set down by me and begun to whisper and said we could all be joyful now because all the symptoms was firstrate and hed been sleeping like that for ever so long and looking better and peacefuller all the time and ten to one hed wake up in his right mind so we set there watching and by and by he stirs a bit and opened his eyes very natural and takes a look and says hellowhy im at home hows that wheres the raft its all right i says and jim the same i says but couldnt say it pretty brash but he never noticed but says good splendid now were all right and safe did you tell aunty i was going to say yes but she chipped in and says about what sid why about the way the whole thing was done what whole thing why the whole thing there aint but one how we set the runaway nigger freeme and tom good land set the runwhat is the child talking about dear dear out of his head again no i aint out of my head i know all what im talking about we did set him freeme and tom we laid out to do it and we done it and we done it elegant too hed got a start and she never checked him up just set and stared and stared and let him clip along and i see it warnt no use for me to put in why aunty it cost us a power of work weeks of ithours and hours every night whilst you was all asleep and we had to steal candles and the sheet and the shirt and your dress and spoons and tin plates and caseknives and the warmingpan and the grindstone and flour and just no end of things and you cant think what work it was to make the saws and pens and inscriptions and one thing or another and you cant think half the fun it was and we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things and nonnamous letters from the robbers and get up and down the lightningrod and dig the hole into the cabin and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket mercy sakes and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on for company for jim and then you kept tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business because the men come before we was out of the cabin and we had to rush and they heard us and let drive at us and i got my share and we dodged out of the path and let them go by and when the dogs come they warnt interested in us but went for the most noise and we got our canoe and made for the raft and was all safe and jim was a free man and we done it all by ourselves and wasnt it bully aunty well i never heard the likes of it in all my born days so it was you you little rapscallions thats been making all this trouble and turned everybodys wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death ive as good a notion as ever i had in my life to take it out o you this very minute to think here ive been night after night ayou just get well once you young scamp and i lay ill tan the old harry out o both o ye but tom he was so proud and joyful he just couldnt hold in and his tongue just went itshe achipping in and spitting fire all along and both of them going it at once like a cat convention and she says well you get all the enjoyment you can out of it now for mind i tell you if i catch you meddling with him again meddling with who tom says dropping his smile and looking surprised with who why the runaway nigger of course whod you reckon tom looks at me very grave and says tom didnt you just tell me he was all right hasnt he got away him says aunt sally the runaway nigger deed he hasnt theyve got him back safe and sound and hes in that cabin again on bread and water and loaded down with chains till hes claimed or sold tom rose square up in bed with his eye hot and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills and sings out to me they haint no right to shut him up shoveand dont you lose a minute turn him loose he aint no slave hes as free as any cretur that walks this earth what does the child mean i mean every word i say aunt sally and if somebody dont go ill go ive knowed him all his life and so has tom there old miss watson died two months ago and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river and said so and she set him free in her will then what on earth did you want to set him free for seeing he was already free well that is a question i must say and just like women why i wanted the adventure of it and id a waded neckdeep in blood to goodness alive aunt polly if she warnt standing right there just inside the door looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie i wish i may never aunt sally jumped for her and most hugged the head off of her and cried over her and i found a good enough place for me under the bed for it was getting pretty sultry for us seemed to me and i peeped out and in a little while toms aunt polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at tom over her spectacleskind of grinding him into the earth you know and then she says yes you better turn yr head awayi would if i was you tom oh deary me says aunt sally is he changed so why that aint tom its sid tomstomswhy where is tom he was here a minute ago you mean wheres huck finnthats what you mean i reckon i haint raised such a scamp as my tom all these years not to know him when i see him that would be a pretty howdydo come out from under that bed huck finn so i done it but not feeling brash aunt sally she was one of the mixedupestlooking persons i ever see except one and that was uncle silas when he come in and they told it all to him it kind of made him drunk as you may say and he didnt know nothing at all the rest of the day and preached a prayermeeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation because the oldest man in the world couldnt a understood it so toms aunt polly she told all about who i was and what and i had to up and tell how i was in such a tight place that when mrs phelps took me for tom sawyershe chipped in and says oh go on and call me aunt sally im used to it now and taint no need to changethat when aunt sally took me for tom sawyer i had to stand itthere warnt no other way and i knowed he wouldnt mind because it would be nuts for him being a mystery and hed make an adventure out of it and be perfectly satisfied and so it turned out and he let on to be sid and made things as soft as he could for me and his aunt polly she said tom was right about old miss watson setting jim free in her will and so sure enough tom sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free and i couldnt ever understand before until that minute and that talk how he could help a body set a nigger free with his bringingup well aunt polly she said that when aunt sally wrote to her that tom and sid had come all right and safe she says to herself look at that now i might have expected it letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him so now i got to go and trapse all the way down the river eleven hundred mile and find out what that creeturs up to this time as long as i couldnt seem to get any answer out of you about it why i never heard nothing from you says aunt sally well i wonder why i wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by sid being here well i never got em sis aunt polly she turns around slow and severe and says you tom wellwhat he says kind of pettish don t you what me you impudent thinghand out them letters what letters them letters i be bound if i have to take aholt of you ill theyre in the trunk there now and theyre just the same as they was when i got them out of the office i haint looked into them i haint touched them but i knowed theyd make trouble and i thought if you warnt in no hurry id well you do need skinning there aint no mistake about it and i wrote another one to tell you i was coming and i spose he no it come yesterday i haint read it yet but its all right ive got that one i wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadnt but i reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to so i never said nothing chapter the last the first time i catched tom private i asked him what was his idea time of the evasionwhat it was hed planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before and he said what he had planned in his head from the start if we got jim out all safe was for us to run him down the river on the raft and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river and then tell him about his being free and take him back up home on a steamboat in style and pay him for his lost time and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brassband and then he would be a hero and so would we but i reckoned it was about as well the way it was we had jim out of the chains in no time and when aunt polly and uncle silas and aunt sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse tom they made a heap of fuss over him and fixed him up prime and give him all he wanted to eat and a good time and nothing to do and we had him up to the sickroom and had a high talk and tom give jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient and doing it up so good and jim was pleased most to death and busted out and says dah now huck what i tell youwhat i tell you up dah on jackson islan i tole you i got a hairy breas en whats de sign un it en i tole you i ben rich wunst en gwineter to be rich agin en its come true en heah she is dah now doan talk to mesigns is signs mine i tell you en i knowed jis s well at i uz gwineter be rich agin as is astannin heah dis minute and then tom he talked along and talked along and says les all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit and go for howling adventures amongst the injuns over in the territory for a couple of weeks or two and i says all right that suits me but i aint got no money for to buy the outfit and i reckon i couldnt get none from home because its likely paps been back before now and got it all away from judge thatcher and drunk it up no he haint tom says its all there yetsix thousand dollars and more and your pap haint ever been back since hadnt when i come away anyhow jim says kind of solemn he aint acomin back no mo huck i says why jim nemmine why huckbut he aint comin back no mo but i kept at him so at last he says doan you member de house dat was floatn down de river en dey wuz a man in dah kivered up en i went in en unkivered him and didn let you come in well den you kin git yo money when you wants it kase dat wuz him toms most well now and got his bullet around his neck on a watchguard for a watch and is always seeing what time it is and so there aint nothing more to write about and i am rotten glad of it because if id a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book i wouldnt a tackled it and aint agoing to no more but i reckon i got to light out for the territory ahead of the rest because aunt sally shes going to adopt me and sivilize me and i cant stand it i been there before the end yours truly huck finn end of the project gutenberg ebook of adventures of huckleberry finn complete by mark twain samuel clemens end of this
